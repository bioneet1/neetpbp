To understand changes in flora and fauna over millions of years, we must understand the context of origin of life.<br><br>3. Evolution must be understood in the context of evolution of earth, stars, and the universe itself.<br><br>4. The story of origin of life and evolution of life forms is the longest of all construed and conjectured stories.<br><br>5. Stellar distances are measured in light years.<br><br>6. When we look at stars, we are looking back in time.<br><br>7. Light from stars that we see today started its journey millions of years back.<br><br>8. Light from stars travels trillions of kilometres before reaching our eyes.<br><br>9. Objects in our immediate surroundings are seen instantly and hence in the present time.<br><br>10.

Huge clusters of galaxies comprise the universe and galaxies contain stars and clouds of gas and dust.<br><br>3.

The gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the present day universe.<br><br>7. Earth was supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back in the solar system of the milky way galaxy.<br><br>8. There was no atmosphere on early earth and water vapour, methane, carbondioxide and ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface.<br><br>9. UV rays from the sun brokeup water into Hydrogen and Oxygen and the lighter Hydrogen escaped.<br><br>10. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water, carbon dioxide and others.<br><br>11. The ozone layer was formed as earth cooled.<br><br>12. As it cooled, the water vapor fell as rain to fill all the depressions and form oceans.<br><br>13.

Panspermia is the theory that life came from outerspace and is still a favourite idea for some astronomers.<br><br>15. Early Greek thinkers thought units of life called spores were transferred to different planets including earth.<br><br>16. The theory of spontaneous generation proposed that life came out of decaying and rotting matter like straw and mud.<br><br>17. Louis Pasteur by careful experimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life.<br><br>18. Louis Pasteur showed that in pre-sterilised flasks, life did not come from killed yeast while in another flask open to air, new living organisms arose from killed yeast.<br><br>19. Spontaneous generation theory was dismissed once and for all but it did not answer how the first life form came on earth.<br><br>20. Oparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that the first form of life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules like RNA and protein.<br><br>21. Formation of life was preceded by chemical evolution, that is, formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic constituents.<br><br>22. The conditions on earth that favored chemical evolution were high temperature, volcanic storms, and reducing atmosphere containing methane and ammonia.<br><br>23. In 1953, S.L. Miller created similar conditions in a laboratory scale by creating electric discharge in a closed flask containing methane, hydrogen, ammonia and water vapour at 800 degree C.<br><br>24. S.L. Miller observed formation of amino acids in his experiment.<br><br>25. In similar experiments others observed formation of sugars, nitrogen bases, pigment and fats.<br><br>26. Analysis of meteorite content revealed similar compounds indicating that similar processes are occurring elsewhere in space.<br><br>27. With the limited evidence from Miller experiment, chemical evolution was more or less accepted.<br><br>28. We have no idea about how the first self replicating metabolic capsule of life arose.<br><br>29. The first non-cellular forms of life could have originated 3 billion years back.<br><br>30. The first non-cellular forms of life could have been giant molecules like RNA and Protein."],
          "112": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The first cellular form of life did not possibly originate till about 2000 million years ago.<br><br>2. The first cellular forms were probably single-cells.<br><br>3. All life forms were in water environment only during early stages of life evolution.<br><br>4. The first form of life arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules and this version of biogenesis is accepted by majority.<br><br>5. How the first cellular forms of life evolved into the complex biodiversity of today is the fascinating topic of study of evolution.<br><br>6. The theory of special creation has three connotations.<br><br>7. First connotation of special creation theory is that all living organisms that we see today were created as such.<br><br>8. Second connotation of special creation theory is that the diversity was always the same since creation and will be the same in future also.<br><br>9. Third connotation of special creation theory is that earth is about 4000 years old.<br><br>10. All ideas of special creation theory were strongly challenged during the nineteenth century.<br><br>11. Charles Darwin made observations during a sea voyage in a sail ship called H.M.S. Beagle round the world.<br><br>12. Charles Darwin concluded that existing living forms share similarities to varying degrees not only among themselves but also with life forms that existed millions of years ago.<br><br>13. Many life forms that existed millions of years ago do not exist anymore.<br><br>14. There had been extinctions of different life forms in the years gone by.<br><br>15. New forms of life arose at different periods of history of earth.<br><br>16. There has been gradual evolution of life forms on earth."], 
          "113": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Variation is built in characteristics of populations which enables some to survive better in natural conditions.<br><br>2. Those characteristics which enable survival would outbreed others that are less-endowed to survive under natural conditions.<br><br>3. Another word used for survival ability is fitness of the individual or population.<br><br>4. Fitness according to Darwin refers ultimately and only to reproductive fitness.<br><br>5. Those who are better fit in an environment leave more progeny than others and therefore will survive more.<br><br>6. Better fit individuals are selected by nature and this is called natural selection.<br><br>7. Darwin implied natural selection as a mechanism of evolution.<br><br>8. Alfred Wallace, a naturalist who worked in Malay Archipelago had also come to similar conclusions around the same time as Darwin.<br><br>9. In due course of time, apparently new types of organisms are recognisable.<br><br>10. All the existing life forms share similarities and share common ancestors.<br><br>11. The common ancestors were present at different periods in the history of earth called epochs, periods and eras.<br><br>12. The geological history of earth closely correlates with the biological history of earth.<br><br>13. A permissible conclusion is that earth is very old, not thousand of years as was thought earlier but billions of years old.<br><br>14. Fossils are remains of hard parts of life-forms found in rocks.<br><br>15. Rocks form sediments and a cross-section of earth crust indicates the arrangement of sediments one over the other during the long history of earth.<br><br>16. Different-aged rock sediments contain fossils of different life-forms who probably died during the formation of the particular sediment.<br><br>17. Some fossils appear similar to modern organisms but represent extinct organisms like Dinosaurs.<br><br>18. A study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological period in which they existed.<br><br>19. The study showed that life-forms varied over time and certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time-spans.<br><br>20. New forms of life have arisen at different times in the history of earth.<br><br>21. Evidence from fossils is called paleontological evidence.<br><br>22. Ages of fossils are calculated by radioactive-dating method.<br><br>23. Embryological support for evolution was proposed by Ernst Haeckel based upon observation of certain features during embryonic stage.<br><br>24. Certain features during embryonic stage are common to all vertebrates that are absent in adult.<br><br>25. The embryos of all vertebrates including human develop a row of vestigial gill slit just behind the head.<br><br>26. Vestigial gill slits are functional organs only in fish and not found in any other adult vertebrates.<br><br>27. Ernst Haeckel proposal was disapproved on careful study performed by Karl Ernst von Baer.<br><br>28. Karl Ernst von Baer noted that embryos never pass through the adult stages of other animals.<br><br>29.

          "114": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Similarities in organisms can be interpreted to understand whether common ancestors were shared or not.<br><br>2. Whales, bats, Cheetah and human (all mammals) share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs.<br><br>3. Though forelimbs of whales, bats, Cheetah and human perform different functions in these animals, they have similar anatomical structure.<br><br>4. All forelimbs of whales, bats, Cheetah and human have humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges.<br><br>5. In these animals (whales, bats, Cheetah and human), the same structure developed along different directions due to adaptations to different needs.<br><br>6. When the same structure developed along different directions due to adaptations to different needs, this is divergent evolution.<br><br>7. Structures that show divergent evolution are called homologous structures.<br><br>8. Homology indicates common ancestry.<br><br>9. Other examples of homologous structures are vertebrae of vertebrae.<br><br>10. Hearts or brains are also examples of homologous structures."], 
          "115": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The thorn and tendrils of Bougainvillea and Cucurbita represent homology.<br><br>2. Homology is based on divergent evolution.<br><br>3. Analogy refers to a situation exactly opposite to homology.<br><br>4. Wings of butterfly and of birds look alike but they are not anatomically similar structures though they perform similar functions.<br><br>5. Analogous structures are a result of convergent evolution.<br><br>6. Convergent evolution involves different structures evolving for the same function and hence having similarity.<br><br>7. Other examples of analogy are the eye of the octopus and of mammals.<br><br>8. Flippers of Penguins and Dolphins are examples of analogous structures.<br><br>9. Similar habitat has resulted in selection of similar adaptive features in different groups of organisms but toward the same function.<br><br>10. Sweet potato (root modification) and potato (stem modification) is another example for analogy.<br><br>11. Similarities in proteins and genes performing a given function among diverse organisms give clues to common ancestry.<br><br>12. Biochemical similarities among diverse organisms point to the same shared ancestry as structural similarities.<br><br>13. Man has bred selected plants and animals for agriculture, horticulture, sport or security.<br><br>14. Man has domesticated many wild animals and crops.<br><br>15. The intensive breeding programme has created breeds that differ from other breeds but still are of the same group.<br><br>16. If within hundreds of years man could create new breeds, nature could have done the same over millions of years.<br><br>17. An observation supporting evolution by natural selection comes from England where a collection of moths was made in 1850s before industrialisation.<br><br>18. Before industrialisation in 1850s, there were more white-winged moths on trees than dark-winged or melanised moths.<br><br>19. After industrialisation in 1920, there were more dark-winged moths in the same area.<br><br>20. The proportion of white-winged and dark-winged moths was reversed after industrialisation."],
          "116": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The explanation for moth observation was that predators will spot a moth against a contrasting background.<br><br>2. During post-industrialisation period, the tree trunks became dark due to industrial smoke and soots.<br><br>3. Under the condition of dark tree trunks, the white-winged moth did not survive due to predators and dark-winged or melanised moth survived.<br><br>4. Before industrialisation set in, thick growth of almost white-coloured lichen covered the trees.<br><br>5. In the background of white-coloured lichen, the white-winged moth survived but the dark-coloured moth were picked out by predators.<br><br>6. Lichens can be used as industrial pollution indicators.<br><br>7. Lichens will not grow in areas that are polluted.<br><br>8. Moths that were able to camouflage themselves, that is, hide in the background, survived.<br><br>9. In areas where industrialisation did not occur, for example in rural areas, the count of melanic moths was low.<br><br>10. In a mixed population, those that can better-adapt, survive and increase in population size.<br><br>11. No variant is completely wiped out in a mixed population.<br><br>12. Excess use of herbicides, pesticides, etc., has only resulted in selection of resistant varieties in a much lesser time scale.<br><br>13. Selection of resistant varieties is also true for microbes against which we employ antibiotics or drugs against eukaryotic organisms or cell.<br><br>14. Resistant organisms or cells are appearing in a time scale of months or years and not centuries.<br><br>15. Examples of resistant varieties are examples of evolution by anthropogenic action.<br><br>16. Evolution is not a directed process in the sense of determinism.<br><br>17. Evolution is a stochastic process based on chance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms.<br><br>18. During his journey Darwin went to Galapagos Islands.<br><br>19. At Galapagos Islands, Darwin observed an amazing diversity of creatures.<br><br>20. Of particular interest, small black birds later called Darwin finches amazed Darwin.<br><br>21. Darwin realised that there were many varieties of finches at Galapagos Islands."],
          "117": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Darwin found many varieties of finches in the same island at Galapagos.<br><br>2. All the varieties of finches, Darwin conjectured, evolved on the island itself.<br><br>3. From the original seed-eating features, many other forms with altered beaks arose in finches.<br><br>4. Altered beaks enabled finches to become insectivorous and vegetarian finches.<br><br>5. The process of evolution of different species in a given geographical area starting from a point and literally radiating to other areas of geography or habitats is called adaptive radiation.<br><br>6. Darwin finches represent one of the best examples of adaptive radiation.<br><br>7. Another example of adaptive radiation is Australian marsupials.<br><br>8. A number of marsupials, each different from the other, evolved from an ancestral stock.<br><br>9. Australian marsupials evolved from an ancestral stock but all within the Australian island continent.<br><br>10.

As Giraffes passed on acquired character of elongated neck to succeeding generations, they slowly came to acquire long necks over the years.<br><br>3. Nobody believes Lamarck conjecture about inheritance of acquired characters any more.<br><br>4. The world we see, inanimate and animate, is only the success stories of evolution.<br><br>5. When we describe the story of this world we describe evolution as a process.<br><br>6. When we describe the story of life on earth, we treat evolution as a consequence of a process called natural selection.<br><br>7. We are still not very clear whether to regard evolution and natural selection as processes or end result of unknown processes.<br><br>8. The work of Thomas Malthus on populations influenced Darwin.<br><br>9. Natural selection is based on certain observations which are factual.<br><br>10. Natural resources are limited in an ecosystem.<br><br>11. Populations are stable in size except for seasonal fluctuation.<br><br>12. Members of a population vary in characteristics even though they look superficially similar.<br><br>13. Most of variations in a population are inherited.<br><br>14. Theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody reproduced maximally.<br><br>15. The fact that population sizes in reality are limited means that there had been competition for resources.<br><br>16. Only some organisms survived and grew at the cost of others that could not flourish.<br><br>17. Darwin asserted that variations which are heritable and which make resource utilisation better will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny.<br><br>18. Over many generations, survivors will leave more progeny and there would be a change in population characteristic.<br><br>19. Hence new forms appear to arise over many generations.<br><br>20. Mendel had talked of inheritable factors influencing phenotype.<br><br>21. Darwin either ignored Mendel observations or kept silence.<br><br>22. Hugo deVries based on his work on evening primrose brought forth the idea of mutations.<br><br>23. Mutations are large difference arising suddenly in a population.<br><br>24. Hugo deVries believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and not the minor variations that Darwin talked about.<br><br>25. Mutations are random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and directional.<br><br>26. Evolution for Darwin was gradual while deVries believed mutation caused speciation.<br><br>27.

Several microbes are useful in many ways and contribute to human welfare.<br><br>3. Microbes and products derived from them are used in everyday life.<br><br>4. Lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk and convert it to curd.<br><br>5. During growth, LAB produce acids that coagulate and partially digest milk proteins.<br><br>6. A small amount of curd added to fresh milk as inoculum or starter contains millions of LAB.<br><br>7. At suitable temperatures, LAB multiply and convert milk to curd.<br><br>8. Conversion of milk to curd improves its nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B12.<br><br>9. In the stomach, LAB play a beneficial role in checking disease-causing microbes.<br><br>10. Dough for making dosa and idli is fermented by bacteria.<br><br>11. The puffed-up appearance of dough is due to production of CO2 gas by bacteria.<br><br>12. CO2 in dough is produced by metabolic pathways, not by simple chemical reactions.<br><br>13. Dough for making bread is fermented using baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br><br>14.

Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment.<br><br>11. Primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>12. In aeration tanks, effluent is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>13. Air is pumped into aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>14. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs.<br><br>15. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh-like structures.<br><br>16. Growing microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>17. This significantly reduces the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent.<br><br>18. BOD refers to the amount of oxygen consumed if all organic matter in one litre of water were oxidised by bacteria.<br><br>19. Sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced.<br><br>20. The BOD test measures the rate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a water sample.<br><br>21. Indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present in the water.<br><br>22. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting potential.<br><br>23. Once BOD is reduced significantly, effluent is passed into a settling tank.<br><br>24. In settling tank, bacterial flocs are allowed to sediment.<br><br>25. This sediment is called activated sludge.<br><br>26. A small part of activated sludge is pumped back into aeration tank as inoculum.<br><br>27. The remaining major part of sludge is pumped into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters.<br><br>28. In anaerobic sludge digesters, bacteria grow anaerobically.<br><br>29. These bacteria digest the bacteria and fungi in the sludge.<br><br>30. During digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide.<br><br>31. These gases form biogas which can be used as source of energy.<br><br>32. Biogas is inflammable and can be used as energy source.<br><br>33. The effluent from secondary treatment plant is generally released into natural water bodies like rivers and streams."],

DNA fragments separate according to their size through sieving effect provided by the agarose gel.<br><br>7. The smaller the DNA fragment size, the farther it moves in gel electrophoresis.<br><br>8. The separated DNA fragments can be visualised only after staining with ethidium bromide followed by exposure to UV radiation.<br><br>9. Pure DNA fragments cannot be seen in visible light without staining.<br><br>10. Bright orange coloured bands of DNA are seen in ethidium bromide stained gel exposed to UV light.<br><br>11. The separated bands of DNA are cut out from the agarose gel and extracted from the gel piece.<br><br>12. The process of cutting out and extracting DNA bands from agarose gel is known as elution.<br><br>13. DNA fragments purified by elution are used in constructing recombinant DNA by joining them with cloning vectors.<br><br>14. Plasmids and bacteriophages have the ability to replicate within bacterial cells independent of the control of chromosomal DNA.<br><br>15. Bacteriophages have very high copy numbers of their genome within the bacterial cell because of their high number per cell.<br><br>16. Some plasmids may have only one or two copies per cell whereas others may have 15-100 copies per cell.<br><br>17. The copy numbers of plasmids can go even higher than 100 copies per cell.<br><br>18. If we link an alien piece of DNA with bacteriophage or plasmid DNA, we can multiply its numbers equal to the copy number of the plasmid or bacteriophage.<br><br>19. Cloning vectors are engineered in such a way that they help easy linking of foreign DNA.<br><br>20. Cloning vectors help in selection of recombinants from non-recombinants."],

The enzyme DNA polymerase extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the reaction and the genomic DNA as template.<br><br>3. If the process of DNA replication is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified to approximately billion times.<br><br>4. Repeated amplification is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA polymerase isolated from bacterium Thermus aquaticus.<br><br>5. Thermostable DNA polymerase remains active during the high temperature induced denaturation of double stranded DNA.<br><br>6. The amplified DNA fragment can be used to ligate with a vector for further cloning.<br><br>7.

If a recombinant DNA bearing gene for ampicillin resistance is transferred into E. coli cells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells.<br><br>9. If we spread transformed cells on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformants will grow while untransformed recipient cells will die.<br><br>10. Due to ampicillin resistance gene, one is able to select a transformed cell in the presence of ampicillin.<br><br>11.

The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was still insufficient to feed the growing human population.<br><br>3. Increased yields during Green Revolution were mainly due to improved crop varieties, better management practices, and use of agrochemicals like fertilisers and pesticides.<br><br>4. Agrochemicals are often too expensive for farmers in developing countries limiting their accessibility.<br><br>5. Further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding methods alone.<br><br>6. Traditional breeding techniques failed to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement.<br><br>7. Tissue culture technology was developed during the 1950s when scientists learnt that whole plants could be regenerated from explants.<br><br>8. An explant is any part of a plant taken out and grown in a test tube under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>9. Totipotency is the capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell or explant.<br><br>10. The nutrient medium in tissue culture must provide a carbon source such as sucrose along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators.<br><br>11. Growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins are essential components of tissue culture nutrient medium.<br><br>12. Micro-propagation is the method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture in short durations.<br><br>13. Plants produced through tissue culture are genetically identical to the original plant and are called somaclones.<br><br>14. Important food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been produced on commercial scale using micro-propagation.<br><br>15. Recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants is an important application of tissue culture method.<br><br>16. Even if a plant is infected with a virus, the meristem including apical and axillary regions remains free of virus.<br><br>17. Virus-free plants can be obtained by removing the meristem and growing it in vitro conditions.<br><br>18. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato for virus-free plant production.<br><br>19. Protoplasts are naked plant cells surrounded only by plasma membranes after digestion of their cell walls.<br><br>20. Scientists have isolated single cells from plants and digested their cell walls to obtain isolated protoplasts.<br><br>21. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties with desirable characters can be fused to get hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>22. Hybrid protoplasts can be further grown to form a new plant with combined desirable traits.<br><br>23. Hybrids produced by protoplast fusion are called somatic hybrids and the process is called somatic hybridisation.<br><br>24.

Use of genetically modified crops is a possible solution to minimise fertiliser and chemical usage and their harmful environmental effects.<br><br>4. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) are plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by manipulation.<br><br>5. Genetic modification has made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, salt and heat.<br><br>6. GM crops have reduced reliance on chemical pesticides through development of pest-resistant varieties.<br><br>7.

Bt toxin is produced by a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis and is used in pest resistant plant production.<br><br>12. Bt toxin gene has been cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis and expressed in cotton to create insect resistance without insecticides.<br><br>13. Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and soyabean are examples of pest-resistant GM crops.<br><br>14. Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill lepidopterans like tobacco budworm and armyworm.<br><br>15. Bacillus thuringiensis also kills coleopterans like beetles and dipterans like flies and mosquitoes.<br><br>16. Bacillus thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth.<br><br>17. The protein crystals of Bacillus thuringiensis contain a toxic insecticidal protein.<br><br>18. Bt toxin protein exists as inactive protoxins in the bacterium which do not harm Bacillus thuringiensis itself.<br><br>19. When an insect ingests the inactive Bt toxin, it is converted into active form due to the alkaline pH of the gut.<br><br>20. The alkaline pH of insect gut solubilises the Bt toxin protein crystals converting them to active form.<br><br>21. The activated Bt toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells of insects.<br><br>22. Activated Bt toxin creates pores in midgut epithelial cells that increase cell swelling and lysis.<br><br>23. The pores created by Bt toxin eventually cause death of the insect through cell lysis.<br><br>24.

Meloidogyne incognita is a nematode that infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction in yield.<br><br>9. A novel strategy based on RNA interference (RNAi) was adopted to prevent nematode infestation in tobacco plants.<br><br>10. RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense.<br><br>11. RNA interference involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule.<br><br>12.

Transposons are mobile genetic elements that replicate via an RNA intermediate.<br><br>15. Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plant for RNAi-based resistance.<br><br>16. The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti sense RNA in the host cells.<br><br>17. The sense and antisense RNA are complementary to each other and form a double stranded RNA (dsRNA).<br><br>18.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. In mammals including humans, insulin is synthesised as a pro-hormone containing an extra stretch called the C peptide.<br><br>2. The C peptide is not present in mature insulin and is removed during maturation into functional insulin.<br><br>3. The main challenge for production of insulin using rDNA techniques was getting insulin assembled into a mature form.<br><br>4. In 1983, Eli Lilly an American company prepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B chains of human insulin.<br><br>5. The DNA sequences for insulin chains were introduced into plasmids of E. coli to produce insulin chains.<br><br>6. Chains A and B of insulin were produced separately, extracted and combined by creating disulphide bonds to form human insulin.<br><br>7. Gene therapy is an attempt to provide corrective therapy for hereditary diseases.<br><br>8. Gene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a gene defect diagnosed in a child or embryo.<br><br>9. In gene therapy, genes are inserted into a persons cells and tissues to treat a disease.<br><br>10. Correction of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into the individual or embryo to compensate for the non-functional gene.<br><br>11. The first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency.<br><br>12. Adenosine deaminase enzyme is crucial for the immune system to function properly.<br><br>13. ADA deficiency disorder is caused due to the deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase.<br><br>14. In some children, ADA deficiency can be cured by bone marrow transplantation.<br><br>15. ADA deficiency can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy in which functional ADA is given to the patient by injection.<br><br>16. The problem with bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy is that they are not completely curative.<br><br>17. In gene therapy for ADA deficiency, lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside the body.<br><br>18. A functional ADA cDNA is introduced into lymphocytes using a retroviral vector.<br><br>19. Genetically engineered lymphocytes with functional ADA cDNA are subsequently returned to the patient.<br><br>20. As these genetically modified cells are not immortal, the patient requires periodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes.<br><br>21. If the gene isolated from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells at early embryonic stages, it could lead to permanent cure.<br><br>22. For effective treatment of a disease, early diagnosis and understanding its pathophysiology is very important.<br><br>23. Molecular diagnosis enables early diagnosis and better understanding of disease pathophysiology using conventional methods.<br><br>24. The proinsulin needs to be processed before it becomes a fully mature and functional hormone.<br><br>25. Gene therapy aims to take over the function of and compensate for the non-functional gene by introducing a normal gene."],

Ecology can be studied at various levels of biological organization including organisms, populations, communities and biomes.<br><br>3. Population ecology specifically explores ecological processes at the population level.<br><br>4. A population consists of individuals of a species living in a well defined geographical area, sharing or competing for similar resources, and potentially interbreeding.<br><br>5. Although interbreeding implies sexual reproduction, groups formed through asexual reproduction can also be called populations for ecological studies.<br><br>6. Examples of populations include cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teak wood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate, and lotus plants in a pond.<br><br>7. Natural selection operates at the population level to evolve desired traits, even though individual organisms must cope with environmental changes.<br><br>8. Population ecology is important because it links ecology to population genetics and evolution.<br><br>9. A population has certain attributes that an individual organism does not possess.<br><br>10. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has birth rates and death rates.<br><br>11. Birth rates and death rates in a population refer to per capita births and deaths respectively.<br><br>12. Population rates are expressed as changes in numbers with respect to members of the population.<br><br>13. Birth rate calculation example: If 20 lotus plants produced 8 new plants, the birth rate is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>14. Death rate calculation example: If 4 out of 40 fruitflies died in one week, the death rate is 4 divided by 40 equals 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.<br><br>15. Sex ratio is a population attribute that indicates the proportion of males and females in the population.<br><br>16. An individual can be either male or female, but a population has a sex ratio such as 60 per cent females and 40 per cent males.<br><br>17. A population at any given time is composed of individuals of different ages.<br><br>18. Age distribution is plotted as per cent individuals of a given age or age group for the population.<br><br>19. The age distribution structure when plotted is called the age pyramid.<br><br>20.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Parasitism has evolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher vertebrates.<br><br>2. Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific, meaning they can parasitise only a single species of host.<br><br>3. Both host and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host evolves special mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite, the parasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise them.<br><br>4. In order to be successful with the same host species, parasites evolved special adaptations.<br><br>5. Special adaptations of parasites include the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive system and high reproductive capacity.<br><br>6. The life cycles of parasites are often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host.<br><br>7. The human liver fluke (a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail and a fish) to complete its life cycle.<br><br>8. The malarial parasite needs a vector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts.<br><br>9. Majority of the parasites harm the host; they may reduce the survival, growth and reproduction of the host and reduce its population density.<br><br>10. Parasites might render the host more vulnerable to predation by making it physically weak.<br><br>11. An ideal parasite should be able to thrive within the host without harming it, but natural selection did not lead to the evolution of such totally harmless parasites.<br><br>12. Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites.<br><br>13. The most familiar examples of ectoparasites are the lice on humans and ticks on dogs.<br><br>14. Many marine fish are infested with ectoparasitic copepods.<br><br>15. Cuscuta is a parasitic plant that is commonly found growing on hedge plants.<br><br>16. Cuscuta has lost its chlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution.<br><br>17. Cuscuta derives its nutrition from the host plant which it parasitises.<br><br>18. The female mosquito is not considered a parasite, although it needs our blood for reproduction (not for nutrition).<br><br>19. Endoparasites are those that live inside the host body at different sites (liver, kidney, lungs, red blood cells, etc.).<br><br>20. The life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their extreme specialisation.<br><br>21. The morphological and anatomical features of endoparasites are greatly simplified while emphasising their reproductive potential.<br><br>22. Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism in which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and lets the host incubate them.<br><br>23. During the course of evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the host's egg in size and colour to reduce the chances of the host detecting them."],
