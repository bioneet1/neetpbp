          "177": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Biotechnology essentially deals with industrial scale production of biopharmaceuticals and biologicals using genetically modified organisms.<br><br>2. Genetically modified microbes, fungi, plants and animals are used in biotechnology for large-scale production.<br><br>3. Applications of biotechnology include therapeutics, diagnostics, genetically modified crops, processed food, bioremediation, waste treatment, and energy production.<br><br>4. Three critical research areas of biotechnology are: providing the best catalyst, creating optimal conditions for catalyst action, and downstream processing technologies.<br><br>5. The best catalyst in biotechnology is usually an improved organism, typically a microbe, or a pure enzyme.<br><br>6. Creating optimal conditions through engineering is essential for a catalyst to act effectively in biotechnology processes.<br><br>7. Downstream processing technologies are used to purify the protein or organic compound produced through biotechnology.<br><br>8. Biotechnology has been used by humans to improve the quality of human life, especially in food production and health.<br><br>9. Biotechnological applications in agriculture focus on increasing food production through various approaches.<br><br>10. Agro-chemical based agriculture is one of the three options for increasing food production through biotechnology.<br><br>11. Industrial scale production is the characteristic feature of biotechnology distinguishing it from laboratory-scale work.<br><br>12. Biopharmaceuticals are pharmaceutical products produced using biotechnology methods involving genetically modified organisms.<br><br>13. The three critical research areas of biotechnology work in integration to achieve efficient production of desired products.<br><br>14. Biotechnology applications span across multiple sectors including agriculture, healthcare, environment, and energy.<br><br>15. Processed food production through biotechnology involves enhancement of nutritional or preservation properties."], 
          "178": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Three options for increasing food production are agro-chemical based agriculture, organic agriculture, and genetically engineered crop-based agriculture.<br><br>2. The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was still insufficient to feed the growing human population.<br><br>3. Increased yields during Green Revolution were mainly due to improved crop varieties, better management practices, and use of agrochemicals like fertilisers and pesticides.<br><br>4. Agrochemicals are often too expensive for farmers in developing countries limiting their accessibility.<br><br>5. Further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding methods alone.<br><br>6. Traditional breeding techniques failed to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement.<br><br>7. Tissue culture technology was developed during the 1950s when scientists learnt that whole plants could be regenerated from explants.<br><br>8. An explant is any part of a plant taken out and grown in a test tube under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>9. Totipotency is the capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell or explant.<br><br>10. The nutrient medium in tissue culture must provide a carbon source such as sucrose along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators.<br><br>11. Growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins are essential components of tissue culture nutrient medium.<br><br>12. Micro-propagation is the method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture in short durations.<br><br>13. Plants produced through tissue culture are genetically identical to the original plant and are called somaclones.<br><br>14. Important food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been produced on commercial scale using micro-propagation.<br><br>15. Recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants is an important application of tissue culture method.<br><br>16. Even if a plant is infected with a virus, the meristem including apical and axillary regions remains free of virus.<br><br>17. Virus-free plants can be obtained by removing the meristem and growing it in vitro conditions.<br><br>18. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato for virus-free plant production.<br><br>19. Protoplasts are naked plant cells surrounded only by plasma membranes after digestion of their cell walls.<br><br>20. Scientists have isolated single cells from plants and digested their cell walls to obtain isolated protoplasts.<br><br>21. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties with desirable characters can be fused to get hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>22. Hybrid protoplasts can be further grown to form a new plant with combined desirable traits.<br><br>23. Hybrids produced by protoplast fusion are called somatic hybrids and the process is called somatic hybridisation.<br><br>24. Tissue culture allows propagation of a large number of plants in short durations through micro-propagation technique.<br><br>25. Sterile conditions are essential for growing explants in tissue culture to prevent contamination."], 
          "179": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Somatic hybridisation is the process of fusing protoplasts from different plant varieties to create hybrid plants.<br><br>2. Pomato is a hybrid plant produced by fusion of tomato and potato protoplasts but lacked desired commercial characteristics.<br><br>3. Use of genetically modified crops is a possible solution to minimise fertiliser and chemical usage and their harmful environmental effects.<br><br>4. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) are plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by manipulation.<br><br>5. Genetic modification has made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, salt and heat.<br><br>6. GM crops have reduced reliance on chemical pesticides through development of pest-resistant varieties.<br><br>7. Genetic modification has helped reduce post harvest losses in agricultural produce.<br><br>8. GM crops have increased efficiency of mineral usage by plants which prevents early exhaustion of soil fertility.<br><br>9. Golden rice is a genetically modified crop with enhanced nutritional value containing Vitamin A enrichment.<br><br>10. GM technology has been used to create tailor-made plants supplying alternative resources like starches, fuels and pharmaceuticals to industries.<br><br>11. Bt toxin is produced by a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis and is used in pest resistant plant production.<br><br>12. Bt toxin gene has been cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis and expressed in cotton to create insect resistance without insecticides.<br><br>13. Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and soyabean are examples of pest-resistant GM crops.<br><br>14. Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill lepidopterans like tobacco budworm and armyworm.<br><br>15. Bacillus thuringiensis also kills coleopterans like beetles and dipterans like flies and mosquitoes.<br><br>16. Bacillus thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth.<br><br>17. The protein crystals of Bacillus thuringiensis contain a toxic insecticidal protein.<br><br>18. Bt toxin protein exists as inactive protoxins in the bacterium which do not harm Bacillus thuringiensis itself.<br><br>19. When an insect ingests the inactive Bt toxin, it is converted into active form due to the alkaline pH of the gut.<br><br>20. The alkaline pH of insect gut solubilises the Bt toxin protein crystals converting them to active form.<br><br>21. The activated Bt toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells of insects.<br><br>22. Activated Bt toxin creates pores in midgut epithelial cells that increase cell swelling and lysis.<br><br>23. The pores created by Bt toxin eventually cause death of the insect through cell lysis.<br><br>24. Bt cotton is effectively a bio-pesticide as it produces toxin that kills insects without need for chemical insecticides.<br><br>25. Production of pest resistant plants through biotechnology can decrease the amount of pesticide used in agriculture."],
          "180": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Specific Bt toxin genes were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and incorporated into several crop plants such as cotton.<br><br>2. The choice of cry genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest as most Bt toxins are insect group specific.<br><br>3. The toxin produced by Bt genes is coded by a gene named cry which stands for crystal protein.<br><br>4. The genes cryIAc and cryIIAb encode proteins that control cotton bollworms.<br><br>5. The gene cryIAb encodes protein that controls corn borer.<br><br>6. There are multiple cry genes for example cryIAc, cryIIAb and cryIAb each targeting specific insect pests.<br><br>7. Several nematodes parasitise a wide variety of plants and animals including human beings.<br><br>8. Meloidogyne incognita is a nematode that infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction in yield.<br><br>9. A novel strategy based on RNA interference (RNAi) was adopted to prevent nematode infestation in tobacco plants.<br><br>10. RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense.<br><br>11. RNA interference involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule.<br><br>12. The complementary dsRNA molecule binds to mRNA and prevents translation of the mRNA causing silencing.<br><br>13. The source of complementary RNA in RNAi could be from infection by viruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements like transposons.<br><br>14. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that replicate via an RNA intermediate.<br><br>15. Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plant for RNAi-based resistance.<br><br>16. The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti sense RNA in the host cells.<br><br>17. The sense and antisense RNA are complementary to each other and form a double stranded RNA (dsRNA).<br><br>18. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) initiates RNAi and thus silences the specific mRNA of the nematode.<br><br>19. The consequence of RNAi was that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA.<br><br>20. The transgenic tobacco plant expressing specific interfering RNA prevents survival of Meloidogyne incognita nematode.<br><br>21. RNAi is used as a method to develop pest-resistant plants particularly against nematode infestations.<br><br>22. The mechanism of RNAi provides a targeted approach to control specific pests without affecting other organisms.<br><br>23. Complementary RNA molecules are essential for the RNAi mechanism to function effectively in silencing target genes.<br><br>24. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer is used to introduce nematode-specific genes for creating transgenic pest-resistant plants.<br><br>25. The pest-resistant strategy using RNAi demonstrates biotechnology applications in agriculture for sustainable pest management."],
          "181": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Host plant-generated dsRNA triggers protection against nematode infestation in transgenic plants.<br><br>2. Transgenic plant roots expressing specific interfering RNA prevent nematode survival after infection.<br><br>3. Nematodes are unable to survive in transgenic hosts expressing specific interfering RNA.<br><br>4. Recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense impact in healthcare by enabling mass production of therapeutic drugs.<br><br>5. Recombinant therapeutics are safe and more effective than products isolated from non-human sources.<br><br>6. Recombinant therapeutics do not induce unwanted immunological responses unlike products from non-human sources.<br><br>7. About 30 recombinant therapeutics have been approved for human use worldwide at present.<br><br>8. In India, 12 recombinant therapeutics are presently being marketed.<br><br>9. Management of adult-onset diabetes is possible by taking insulin at regular time intervals.<br><br>10. If human insulin is not available, insulin would have to be isolated from other animals.<br><br>11. Insulin isolated from other animals may not be as effective as that secreted by the human body.<br><br>12. Insulin from other animals can elicit an immune response in the human body.<br><br>13. Using bacterium to produce human insulin makes the production process simple as it can grow easily in nutrient broth.<br><br>14. Growing bacterium in nutrient broth allows production of as much insulin as needed.<br><br>15. Insulin cannot be orally administered to diabetic patients as it is a protein that gets digested in the digestive system.<br><br>16. Insulin used for diabetes was earlier extracted from pancreas of slaughtered cattle and pigs.<br><br>17. Insulin from animal sources caused some patients to develop allergy or other types of reactions to the foreign protein.<br><br>18. Insulin consists of two short polypeptide chains named chain A and chain B.<br><br>19. The two polypeptide chains of insulin (chain A and chain B) are linked together by disulphide bridges.<br><br>20. Genetically engineered insulin is produced using Escherichia coli bacterium through recombinant DNA technology.<br><br>21. Biotechnological applications in medicine focus on production of safe and effective therapeutic drugs.<br><br>22. Recombinant DNA technology eliminates the problem of immunological responses associated with non-human derived therapeutics.<br><br>23. The use of genetically engineered insulin overcomes the allergic reactions caused by animal-derived insulin.<br><br>24. Mass production of human insulin through recombinant DNA technology ensures adequate supply for diabetic patients.<br><br>25. The structure of insulin with two chains linked by disulphide bridges is important for its biological activity."], 
      
          "182": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. In mammals including humans, insulin is synthesised as a pro-hormone containing an extra stretch called the C peptide.<br><br>2. The C peptide is not present in mature insulin and is removed during maturation into functional insulin.<br><br>3. The main challenge for production of insulin using rDNA techniques was getting insulin assembled into a mature form.<br><br>4. In 1983, Eli Lilly an American company prepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B chains of human insulin.<br><br>5. The DNA sequences for insulin chains were introduced into plasmids of E. coli to produce insulin chains.<br><br>6. Chains A and B of insulin were produced separately, extracted and combined by creating disulphide bonds to form human insulin.<br><br>7. Gene therapy is an attempt to provide corrective therapy for hereditary diseases.<br><br>8. Gene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a gene defect diagnosed in a child or embryo.<br><br>9. In gene therapy, genes are inserted into a persons cells and tissues to treat a disease.<br><br>10. Correction of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into the individual or embryo to compensate for the non-functional gene.<br><br>11. The first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency.<br><br>12. Adenosine deaminase enzyme is crucial for the immune system to function properly.<br><br>13. ADA deficiency disorder is caused due to the deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase.<br><br>14. In some children, ADA deficiency can be cured by bone marrow transplantation.<br><br>15. ADA deficiency can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy in which functional ADA is given to the patient by injection.<br><br>16. The problem with bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy is that they are not completely curative.<br><br>17. In gene therapy for ADA deficiency, lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside the body.<br><br>18. A functional ADA cDNA is introduced into lymphocytes using a retroviral vector.<br><br>19. Genetically engineered lymphocytes with functional ADA cDNA are subsequently returned to the patient.<br><br>20. As these genetically modified cells are not immortal, the patient requires periodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes.<br><br>21. If the gene isolated from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells at early embryonic stages, it could lead to permanent cure.<br><br>22. For effective treatment of a disease, early diagnosis and understanding its pathophysiology is very important.<br><br>23. Molecular diagnosis enables early diagnosis and better understanding of disease pathophysiology using conventional methods.<br><br>24. The proinsulin needs to be processed before it becomes a fully mature and functional hormone.<br><br>25. Gene therapy aims to take over the function of and compensate for the non-functional gene by introducing a normal gene."],
          "183": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Recombinant DNA technology, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) serve the purpose of early diagnosis of diseases.<br><br>2. Presence of a pathogen is normally suspected only when the pathogen has produced a disease symptom.<br><br>3. By the time symptoms appear, the concentration of pathogen is already very high in the body and is very difficult to capture or eliminate.<br><br>4. At very low concentration of bacteria or virus when symptoms are not yet visible, conventional diagnosis is not possible.<br><br>5. PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected AIDS patients.<br><br>6. PCR is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected cancer patients.<br><br>7. PCR is a powerful technique to identify many genetic disorders.<br><br>8. A single stranded DNA or RNA tagged with a radioactive molecule called probe is used for detection.<br><br>9. The probe is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of cells followed by detection using autoradiography.<br><br>10. The clone having the mutated gene will not appear on the photographic film because the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.<br><br>11. ELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction.<br><br>12. Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens like proteins and glycoproteins.<br><br>13. Infection by pathogen can also be detected by detecting the antibodies synthesised against the pathogen.<br><br>14. Animals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an extra foreign gene are known as transgenic animals.<br><br>15. Transgenic rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish have been produced.<br><br>16. Over 95 per cent of all existing transgenic animals are mice.<br><br>17. Transgenic animals can be specifically designed to allow the study of how genes are regulated.<br><br>18. Transgenic animals help in studying how genes affect the normal functions of the body and its development.<br><br>19. Study of complex factors involved in growth such as insulin-like growth factor can be done using transgenic animals.<br><br>20. By introducing genes from other species that alter factor formation and studying biological effects, information is obtained about the biological role of the factor.<br><br>21. Many transgenic animals are designed to increase understanding of how genes contribute to the development of disease.<br><br>22. Transgenic animals serve as models for human diseases so that investigation of new treatments is made possible.<br><br>23. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer.<br><br>24. Transgenic animals are specially made to serve as models for human diseases to enable investigation of new treatments.<br><br>25. The techniques PCR and ELISA enable early diagnosis when pathogen concentration is very low and symptoms are not yet visible."],
          "184": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Medicines required to treat certain human diseases can contain biological products but such products are often expensive to make.<br><br>2. Transgenic animals that produce useful biological products can be created by introduction of DNA portion coding for a particular product.<br><br>3. Attempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) and cystic fibrosis using transgenic animals.<br><br>4. In 1997, the first transgenic cow named Rosie produced human protein-enriched milk.<br><br>5. The milk produced by transgenic cow Rosie contained 2.4 grams per litre of human protein.<br><br>6. The milk produced by Rosie contained human alpha-lactalbumin.<br><br>7. The milk from transgenic cow Rosie was nutritionally a more balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk.<br><br>8. Transgenic mice are being developed for use in testing the safety of vaccines before they are used on humans.<br><br>9. Transgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine.<br><br>10. If successful, transgenic mice testing could replace the need to test on monkeys for vaccine safety.<br><br>11. Chemical safety testing is also known as toxicity or safety testing.<br><br>12. The procedure used in chemical safety testing is the same as used in toxicity testing of drugs.<br><br>13. Transgenic animals for chemical safety testing carry genes which make them more sensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals.<br><br>14. Transgenic animals are exposed to toxic substances and the effects are studied.<br><br>15. Toxicity testing in transgenic animals allows us to obtain results in less time.<br><br>16. The manipulation of living organisms by the human race cannot go on without regulation.<br><br>17. Some ethical standards are required to evaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living organisms.<br><br>18. The biological significance of genetic modification is important as it can have unpredictable results when organisms are introduced into the ecosystem.<br><br>19. The Indian Government has set up organisations such as GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee).<br><br>20. GEAC makes decisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of introducing GM-organisms for public services.<br><br>21. The modification or usage of living organisms for public services such as food and medicine sources has created patents being granted.<br><br>22. There is growing public anger that certain companies are being granted patents to produce and sell technologies using genetic materials.<br><br>23. Patents are being granted for technologies that make use of genetic materials, plants and other biological resources.<br><br>24. Genetic materials, plants and biological resources have long been identified, developed and used by farmers and indigenous people of specific regions or countries.<br><br>25. Ethical issues in biotechnology include concerns about morality and biological significance of genetic modification of organisms."],
          "185": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Rice is an important food grain whose presence goes back thousands of years in Asias agricultural history.<br><br>2. There are an estimated 200,000 varieties of rice in India alone.<br><br>3. The diversity of rice in India is one of the richest in the world.<br><br>4. Basmati rice is distinct for its unique aroma and flavour.<br><br>5. 27 documented varieties of Basmati are grown in India.<br><br>6. There is a reference to Basmati in ancient texts, folklore and poetry as it has been grown for centuries.<br><br>7. In 1997, an American company got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and Trademark Office.<br><br>8. The new variety of Basmati has been developed from old Indian farmers varieties.<br><br>9. Indian Basmati was crossed with semi-dwarf varieties and claimed as an invention or a novelty.<br><br>10. The patent extends to functional equivalents, implying that other people selling Basmati rice could be restricted in the US market.<br><br>11. Several attempts have also been made to patent uses, products and processes based on Indian traditional herbal medicines like turmeric and neem.<br><br>12. If patent applications are not countered immediately, other countries or individuals may encash on our rich legacy.<br><br>13. Biopiracy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by multinational companies without proper authorisation and without compensatory payment.<br><br>14. Most industrialised nations are rich financially but poor in biodiversity and traditional knowledge.<br><br>15. The developing and underdeveloped world is rich in biodiversity and traditional knowledge related to bio-resources.<br><br>16. Traditional knowledge related to bio-resources can be exploited to develop modern applications.<br><br>17. Traditional knowledge can also be used to save time, effort and expenditure during commercialisation of bio-resources.<br><br>18. There has been growing realisation of the injustice, inadequate compensation, and benefit sharing between developed and developing countries.<br><br>19. Some nations are developing laws to prevent unauthorised exploitation of their bio-resources and traditional knowledge.<br><br>20. The Indian Parliament has recently cleared the second amendment of the Indian Patents Bill.<br><br>21. The second amendment of Indian Patents Bill takes issues like patent terms, emergency provisions, research and development initiatives into consideration.<br><br>22. Biopiracy involves use of bio-resources by multinational companies and other organisations without proper authorisation from countries and people concerned.<br><br>23. The patent on Basmati rice was an example of biopiracy as it was developed from Indian farmers varieties without proper compensation.<br><br>24. Vigilance is required to immediately counter patent applications that may exploit our traditional knowledge and bio-resources.<br><br>25. Laws are being developed globally to ensure fair compensation and benefit sharing for use of bio-resources and traditional knowledge."],

Many ecologists regard the entire biosphere as a global ecosystem, as a composite of all local ecosystems on Earth.<br><br>4.

Identification and enumeration of plant and animal species of an ecosystem gives its species composition.<br><br>3. Vertical distribution of different species occupying different levels is called stratification.<br><br>4. In a forest, trees occupy top vertical strata or layer, shrubs the second and herbs and grasses occupy the bottom layers.<br><br>5. The four aspects that make ecosystem components function as a unit are productivity, decomposition, energy flow and nutrient cycling.<br><br>6. A pond is a shallow water body in which all the four basic components of an ecosystem are well exhibited.<br><br>7. The abiotic component of a pond includes water with all dissolved inorganic and organic substances and the rich soil deposit at the bottom.<br><br>8. The solar input, the cycle of temperature, day-length and other climatic conditions regulate the rate of function of the entire pond.<br><br>9. The autotrophic components of a pond include phytoplankton, some algae and the floating, submerged and marginal plants found at the edges.<br><br>10. The consumers in a pond are represented by the zooplankton, the free swimming and bottom dwelling forms.<br><br>11. The decomposers of a pond are fungi, bacteria and flagellates especially abundant in the bottom.<br><br>12. A pond system performs all the functions of any ecosystem and of the biosphere as a whole.<br><br>13. In an ecosystem, conversion of inorganic into organic material occurs with the help of radiant energy of the sun by the autotrophs.<br><br>14. Consumption of autotrophs by heterotrophs is a function performed in ecosystems.<br><br>15. Decomposition and mineralisation of dead matter occurs to release them back for reuse by the autotrophs.<br><br>16. The events of conversion, consumption and decomposition are repeated over and over again in an ecosystem.<br><br>17. There is unidirectional flow of energy from solar or chemical energy to heat energy at each trophic level.<br><br>18. Energy dissipation and loss as heat to the environment occurs at each trophic level.<br><br>19.

Primary production is expressed in terms of weight (g m-2) or energy (kcal m-2).<br><br>3. The rate of biomass production is called productivity and is expressed in terms of g m-2 yr-1 or (kcal m-2) yr-1 to compare productivity of different ecosystems.<br><br>4. Productivity can be divided into gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP).<br><br>5. Gross primary productivity of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter during photosynthesis.<br><br>6. A considerable amount of GPP is utilised by plants in respiration.<br><br>7. Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R) is the net primary productivity (NPP). Formula: GPP - R = NPP.<br><br>8. Net primary productivity is the available biomass for the consumption to heterotrophs (herbivores and decomposers).<br><br>9. Secondary productivity is defined as the rate of formation of new organic matter by consumers.<br><br>10. Primary productivity depends on the plant species inhabiting a particular area.<br><br>11. Primary productivity depends on variety of environmental factors, availability of nutrients and photosynthetic capacity of plants.<br><br>12. Primary productivity varies in different types of ecosystems.<br><br>13. The annual net primary productivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons (dry weight) of organic matter.<br><br>14. Despite occupying about 70 per cent of the surface, the productivity of the oceans are only 55 billion tons.<br><br>15. Decomposers break down complex organic matter into inorganic substances like carbon dioxide, water and nutrients and the process is called decomposition.<br><br>16. Dead plant remains such as leaves, bark, flowers and dead remains of animals including fecal matter constitute detritus.<br><br>17. Detritus is the raw material for decomposition.<br><br>18. The important steps in the process of decomposition are fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification and mineralisation.<br><br>19. Detritivores (e.g., earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles and this process is called fragmentation.<br><br>20. By the process of leaching, water-soluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated as unavailable salts.<br><br>21. Bacteria and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into simpler inorganic substances and this process is called catabolism.<br><br>22. All the steps in decomposition operate simultaneously on the detritus.<br><br>23. Humification and mineralisation occur in the soil.<br><br>24.
