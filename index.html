}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Fibrinogens are plasma proteins needed for clotting or coagulation of blood.<br><br>2. Globulins are primarily involved in defense mechanisms of the body.<br><br>3. Albumins help in maintaining osmotic balance in the blood.<br><br>4. Plasma contains small amounts of minerals like Na+, Ca++, Mg++, HCO3-, Cl-.<br><br>5. Glucose, amino acids, and lipids are present in plasma as they are always in transit in the body.<br><br>6. Factors for coagulation or clotting of blood are present in plasma in an inactive form.<br><br>7. Plasma without the clotting factors is called serum.<br><br>8. Erythrocytes, leucocytes, and platelets are collectively called formed elements.<br><br>9. Formed elements constitute nearly 45 per cent of the blood.<br><br>10. Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant of all cells in blood.<br><br>11. A healthy adult man has, on an average, 5 millions to 5.5 millions of RBCs mm-3 of blood.<br><br>12. RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow in adults.<br><br>13. RBCs are devoid of nucleus in most mammals.<br><br>14. RBCs are biconcave in shape in mammals.<br><br>15. RBCs have a red coloured, iron containing complex protein called haemoglobin.<br><br>16. Haemoglobin gives the colour and name to red blood cells.<br><br>17. A healthy individual has 12-16 gms of haemoglobin in every 100 ml of blood.<br><br>18. Haemoglobin molecules play a significant role in transport of respiratory gases.<br><br>19. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which they are destroyed.<br><br>20. RBCs are destroyed in the spleen, which is called the graveyard of RBCs.<br><br>21. Leucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC).<br><br>22. Leucocytes are colourless due to the lack of haemoglobin.<br><br>23. Leucocytes are nucleated cells.<br><br>24. Leucocytes are relatively lesser in number, averaging 6000-8000 mm-3 of blood.<br><br>25. Leucocytes are generally short lived.<br><br>26. Two main categories of WBCs are granulocytes and agranulocytes.<br><br>27. Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are different types of granulocytes.<br><br>28.

A reduction in platelet number can lead to clotting disorders which will lead to excessive loss of blood from the body.<br><br>9. Blood of human beings differ in certain aspects though it appears to be similar.<br><br>10. Two widely used blood grouping systems all over the world are ABO and Rh.<br><br>11. ABO grouping is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens on the RBCs namely A and B.<br><br>12. Antigens are chemicals that can induce immune response.<br><br>13. The plasma of different individuals contain two natural antibodies.<br><br>14. Antibodies are proteins produced in response to antigens.<br><br>15. The distribution of antigens and antibodies in the four groups of blood are A, B, AB, and O.<br><br>16. Blood group A has A antigen on RBCs and anti-B antibodies in plasma.<br><br>17.

The Rh antigen is observed on the surface of RBCs of majority (nearly 80 per cent) of humans.<br><br>3. Individuals having Rh antigen are called Rh positive (Rh+ve).<br><br>4. Individuals in whom Rh antigen is absent are called Rh negative (Rh-ve).<br><br>5. An Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form specific antibodies against the Rh antigens.<br><br>6. Rh group should also be matched before blood transfusions to avoid incompatibility.<br><br>7. A special case of Rh incompatibility has been observed between Rh-ve blood of pregnant mother with Rh+ve blood of foetus.<br><br>8. Rh antigens of the foetus do not get exposed to the Rh-ve blood of mother in first pregnancy as the two bloods are well separated by placenta.<br><br>9. During delivery of the first child, there is a possibility of exposure of maternal blood to small amounts of Rh+ve blood from foetus.<br><br>10. In such cases, the mother starts preparing antibodies against Rh antigen in her blood.<br><br>11. In case of subsequent pregnancies, the Rh antibodies from mother (Rh-ve) can leak into blood of foetus (Rh+ve) and destroy foetal RBCs.<br><br>12. This could be fatal to the foetus or could cause severe anaemia and jaundice to the baby.<br><br>13. The condition of destruction of foetal RBCs is called erythroblastosis foetalis.<br><br>14. Erythroblastosis foetalis can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies to the mother immediately after delivery of the first child.<br><br>15. When you cut your finger or hurt yourself, the wound does not continue to bleed for a long time as blood stops flowing after sometime.<br><br>16. Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting in response to an injury or trauma.<br><br>17. Coagulation is a mechanism to prevent excessive loss of blood from the body.<br><br>18. A dark reddish brown scum is formed at the site of a cut or injury over a period of time.<br><br>19. It is a clot or coagulum formed mainly of a network of threads called fibrins.<br><br>20. Dead and damaged formed elements of blood are trapped in the fibrin network.<br><br>21. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in the plasma by the enzyme thrombin.<br><br>22. Thrombins are formed from another inactive substance present in plasma called prothrombin.<br><br>23. An enzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.<br><br>24. Thrombokinase complex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade process).<br><br>25. The cascade process involves a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive state.<br><br>26. An injury or trauma stimulates the platelets in blood to release certain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation.<br><br>27. Certain factors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate coagulation.<br><br>28. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting."],

Interstitial fluid has the same mineral distribution as that in plasma.<br><br>5. Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between blood and cells always occur through interstitial fluid.<br><br>6. An elaborate network of vessels called the lymphatic system collects interstitial fluid and drains it back to major veins.<br><br>7. The fluid present in the lymphatic system is called lymph.<br><br>8. Lymph is a colourless fluid containing specialised lymphocytes.<br><br>9.

Open circulatory system is present in arthropods and molluscs.<br><br>14. In open circulatory system, blood pumped by heart passes through large vessels into open spaces or body cavities called sinuses.<br><br>15. Annelids and chordates have a closed circulatory system.<br><br>16. In closed circulatory system, blood pumped by heart is always circulated through a closed network of blood vessels.<br><br>17.

A bundle of nodal fibres, atrio-ventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN.<br><br>10. The AV bundle passes through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of inter-ventricular septum.<br><br>11. The AV bundle immediately divides into a right and left bundle on the inter-ventricular septum.<br><br>12.

The semilunar valves are closed when tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open at the start of cardiac cycle.<br><br>22. The SAN generates an action potential which stimulates both atria to undergo simultaneous contraction - the atrial systole.<br><br>23. Atrial systole increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about 30 per cent.<br><br>24. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature.<br><br>25. This causes the ventricular muscles to contract, called ventricular systole.<br><br>26. During ventricular systole, the atria undergo relaxation called diastole, coinciding with ventricular systole.<br><br>27.

Protonephridia or flame cells are the excretory structures in Platyhelminthes like Planaria, rotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate Amphioxus.<br><br>3. Protonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and fluid volume regulation, i.e., osmoregulation.<br><br>4. Nephridia are the tubular excretory structures of earthworms and other annelids.<br><br>5. Nephridia help in removal of nitrogenous wastes and maintain a fluid and ionic balance.<br><br>6.

The ascending limb of Henles loop continues as another highly coiled tubular region called distal convoluted tubule or DCT.<br><br>4. The distal convoluted tubules of many nephrons open into a straight tube called collecting duct.<br><br>5. Many collecting ducts converge and open into the renal pelvis through medullary pyramids in the calyces.<br><br>6. The Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and DCT of the nephron are situated in the cortical region of the kidney.<br><br>7. The loop of Henle dips into the medulla region of the kidney.<br><br>8. In majority of nephrons, the loop of Henle is too short and extends only very little into the medulla. Such nephrons are called cortical nephrons.<br><br>9. In some nephrons, the loop of Henle is very long and runs deep into the medulla. These nephrons are called juxtamedullary nephrons.<br><br>10. The efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a fine capillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubular capillaries.<br><br>11. A minute vessel of the peritubular capillary network runs parallel to the Henles loop forming a U shaped vasa recta.<br><br>12. Vasa recta is absent or highly reduced in cortical nephrons.<br><br>13. Urine formation involves three main processes: glomerular filtration, reabsorption and secretion that takes place in different parts of the nephron.<br><br>14.

The blood filtered per minute constitutes roughly 1/5th of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a minute.<br><br>17.

GFR in a healthy individual is approximately 125 ml per minute, i.e., 180 litres per day.<br><br>3. The kidneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerular filtration rate.<br><br>4. Juxta glomerular apparatus (JGA) is a special sensitive region formed by cellular modifications in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferent arteriole at the location of their contact.<br><br>5. A fall in GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR back to normal.<br><br>6. The volume of filtrate formed per day is 180 litres while urine released is 1.5 litres, suggesting that nearly 99 per cent of the filtrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules.<br><br>7. The process by which nearly 99 per cent of filtrate is reabsorbed by renal tubules is called reabsorption.<br><br>8. The tubular epithelial cells in different segments of nephron perform reabsorption either by active or passive mechanisms.<br><br>9. Substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+ etc. in the filtrate are reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by passive transport.<br><br>10. Reabsorption of water occurs passively in the initial segments of the nephron.<br><br>11. During urine formation, the tubular cells secrete substances like H+, K+ and ammonia into the filtrate.<br><br>12. Tubular secretion is an important step in urine formation as it helps in the maintenance of ionic and acid base balance of body fluids.<br><br>13. Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is lined by simple cuboidal brush border epithelium which increases the surface area for reabsorption.<br><br>14. Nearly all of the essential nutrients, and 70-80 per cent of electrolytes and water are reabsorbed by PCT segment.<br><br>15. PCT helps to maintain the pH and ionic balance of the body fluids by selective secretion of hydrogen ions and ammonia into the filtrate and by absorption of HCO3- from it.<br><br>16. In Henles loop, reabsorption is minimum in its ascending limb.<br><br>17. The ascending limb of Henles loop plays a significant role in the maintenance of high osmolarity of medullary interstitial fluid.<br><br>18.

The ascending limb of Henles loop is impermeable to water but allows transport of electrolytes actively or passively.<br><br>21. As the concentrated filtrate passes upward in the ascending limb, it gets diluted due to the passage of electrolytes to the medullary fluid.<br><br>22. Distal convoluted tubule (DCT) performs conditional reabsorption of Na+ and water.<br><br>23.

Based on appearance, cardiac muscles are striated.<br><br>4. Cardiac muscles are involuntary in nature as the nervous system does not control their activities directly.<br><br>5. Each organised skeletal muscle is made of a number of muscle bundles or fascicles.<br><br>6. Muscle bundles or fascicles are held together by a common collagenous connective tissue layer called fascia.<br><br>7. Each muscle bundle contains a number of muscle fibres.<br><br>8. Each muscle fibre is lined by the plasma membrane called sarcolemma.<br><br>9. Sarcolemma encloses the sarcoplasm.<br><br>10. Muscle fibre is a syncytium as the sarcoplasm contains many nuclei.<br><br>11. The endoplasmic reticulum of the muscle fibres is the store house of calcium ions.<br><br>12. A characteristic feature of muscle fibre is the presence of large number of parallelly arranged filaments in the sarcoplasm called myofibrils.<br><br>13. Each myofibril has alternate dark and light bands on it.<br><br>14. The striated appearance is due to the distribution pattern of two important proteins namely Actin and Myosin.<br><br>15. The light bands contain actin and is called I or Isotropic band.<br><br>16. The dark band contains myosin and is called A or Anisotropic band."],

Both proteins are also arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the myofibrils.<br><br>3. Actin filaments are thinner as compared to myosin filaments.<br><br>4. Actin filaments are commonly called thin filaments.<br><br>5. Myosin filaments are commonly called thick filaments.<br><br>6. In the centre of each I band is an elastic fibre called Z line which bisects it.<br><br>7. The thin filaments are firmly attached to the Z line.<br><br>8. Thinner filaments in the A band are held together in the middle of this band by a thin fibrous membrane called M line.<br><br>9. The Z and M bands appear alternatively throughout the length of the myofibrils.<br><br>10. The portion of the myofibril between two successive Z lines is considered as the functional unit of contraction.<br><br>11. The functional unit of contraction is called a sarcomere.<br><br>12. In a resting state, edges of thin filaments on either side of thick filaments partially overlap the free ends of thick filaments.<br><br>13. In resting state, a central part of thick filaments is left not overlapped by thin filaments.<br><br>14. This central part of thick filament not overlapped by thin filaments is called the H zone."], 
          "221": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Each actin thin filament is made of two F filamentous actins helically wound to each other.<br><br>2. Each F actin is a polymer of monomeric G globular actins.<br><br>3. Two filaments of another protein tropomyosin run close to the F actins throughout its length.<br><br>4. A complex protein Troponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin.<br><br>5. In resting state, a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for myosin on the actin filaments.<br><br>6. Each myosin thick filament is a polymerised protein.<br><br>7. Many monomeric proteins called Meromyosins constitute one thick filament.<br><br>8. Each meromyosin has two important parts namely a globular head with a short arm and a tail.<br><br>9. The globular head with short arm is called the heavy meromyosin HMM.<br><br>10. The tail is called the light meromyosin LMM.<br><br>11.

          "222": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous system via a motor neuron.<br><br>2. A motor neuron along with the muscle fibres connected to it constitute a motor unit.<br><br>3. The junction between a motor neuron and the sarcolemma of muscle fibre is called the neuromuscular junction or motor end plate.<br><br>4. A neural signal reaching the neuromuscular junction releases a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.<br><br>5. Acetylcholine generates an action potential in the sarcolemma.<br><br>6. The action potential spreads through the muscle fibre and causes release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm.<br><br>7. Increase in calcium level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on actin filaments.<br><br>8. Binding of calcium with troponin removes the masking of active sites for myosin.<br><br>9. Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head binds to the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge.<br><br>10. The cross bridge formation pulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of A band.<br><br>11. The Z line attached to actins are pulled inwards thereby causing a shortening of the sarcomere which is contraction.<br><br>12. During shortening of muscle or contraction, the I bands get reduced.<br><br>13. During muscle contraction, the A bands retain their length.<br><br>14. The myosin releases the ADP and Pi and goes back to its relaxed state.<br><br>15. A new ATP binds to myosin and the cross bridge is broken.<br><br>16. The ATP is again hydrolysed and the cross bridge is formed again."],

The process continues till calcium ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae.<br><br>3. Pumping back of calcium ions results in the masking of actin filaments.<br><br>4. Masking of actin filaments causes the return of Z lines back to their original position which is relaxation.<br><br>5. The reaction time of the fibres can vary in different muscles.<br><br>6. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid.<br><br>7. Lactic acid accumulation is due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen in muscles.<br><br>8. Accumulation of lactic acid causes fatigue.<br><br>9. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storage pigment called myoglobin.<br><br>10.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Dendrites transmit impulses towards the cell body of the neuron.<br><br>2. The axon is a long fibre and the distal end of axon is branched.<br><br>3. Each branch of axon terminates as a bulb-like structure called synaptic knob.<br><br>4. Synaptic knob possesses synaptic vesicles containing chemicals called neurotransmitters.<br><br>5. The axons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body to a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction.<br><br>6. Based on the number of axon and dendrites, neurons are divided into three types: multipolar, bipolar and unipolar.<br><br>7. Multipolar neurons have one axon and many dendrites and are found in the cerebral cortex.<br><br>8. Bipolar neurons have one axon and one dendrite and are found in the retina of eye.<br><br>9. Unipolar neurons have cell body with one axon only and are found usually in the embryonic stage.<br><br>10. There are two types of axons: myelinated and non-myelinated.<br><br>11. The myelinated nerve fibres are enveloped with Schwann cells which form a myelin sheath around the axon.<br><br>12. The gaps between two adjacent myelin sheaths are called nodes of Ranvier.<br><br>13. Myelinated nerve fibres are found in spinal and cranial nerves.<br><br>14. Unmyelinated nerve fibres are enclosed by a Schwann cell that does not form a myelin sheath around the axon.<br><br>15. Unmyelinated nerve fibres are commonly found in autonomous and somatic neural systems.<br><br>16. Neurons are excitable cells because their membranes are in a polarised state.<br><br>17. Different types of ion channels are present on the neural membrane which are selectively permeable to different ions.<br><br>18. When a neuron is not conducting any impulse (resting state), the axonal membrane is comparatively more permeable to potassium ions and nearly impermeable to sodium ions.<br><br>19. The membrane is impermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm.<br><br>20. The axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration of potassium ions and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of sodium ions.<br><br>21. The fluid outside the axon contains a low concentration of potassium ions and a high concentration of sodium ions.<br><br>22. Ionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the active transport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump.<br><br>23. The sodium-potassium pump transports 3 sodium ions outwards for 2 potassium ions into the cell.<br><br>24. As a result of ionic distribution, the outer surface of the axonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface possesses a negative charge."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The electrical potential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called the resting potential.<br><br>2. When a stimulus is applied at a site on the polarised membrane, the membrane at that site becomes freely permeable to sodium ions.<br><br>3. Free permeability to sodium ions leads to a rapid influx of sodium ions into the cell.<br><br>4. The rapid influx of sodium ions is followed by the reversal of the polarity of the membrane.<br><br>5. During depolarisation, the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and the inner side becomes positively charged.<br><br>6. The polarity of the membrane at the site of stimulation is thus reversed and hence the membrane is depolarised.<br><br>7. The electrical potential difference across the plasma membrane at the site of stimulation is called the action potential.<br><br>8. Action potential is in fact termed as a nerve impulse.<br><br>9. At sites immediately ahead of the depolarised region, the axon membrane has a positive charge on the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface.<br><br>10. As a result of charge difference, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B.<br><br>11. On the outer surface, current flows from site B to site A to complete the circuit of current flow.<br><br>12. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed and an action potential is generated at the next site.<br><br>13. Thus, the impulse (action potential) generated at one site arrives at the next site.<br><br>14. The sequence is repeated along the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted.<br><br>15. The stimulus-induced permeability to sodium ions is extremely short-lived.<br><br>16. The increased permeability to sodium is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to potassium ions.<br><br>17. Within a fraction of a second, potassium ions diffuse outside the membrane.<br><br>18. The efflux of potassium ions restores the resting potential of the membrane at the site of excitation.<br><br>19. The conduction of nerve impulse involves depolarisation followed by repolarisation of the membrane.<br><br>20. The nerve impulse travels as a wave of depolarisation along the length of the axon."],

The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones commonly called corticoids.<br><br>3. The corticoids which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids.<br><br>4. Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid in our body.<br><br>5. Corticoids which regulate the balance of water and electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids.<br><br>6. Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid in our body.<br><br>7. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis.<br><br>8. Glucocorticoids inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids.<br><br>9. Cortisol is involved in maintaining the cardiovascular system as well as the kidney functions.<br><br>10. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produce anti-inflammatory reactions and suppress the immune response.<br><br>11. Cortisol stimulates the red blood cell production.<br><br>12. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal tubules.<br><br>13. Aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of sodium and water in renal tubules.<br><br>14. Aldosterone stimulates the excretion of potassium and phosphate ions.<br><br>15. Aldosterone helps in the maintenance of electrolytes, body fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure.<br><br>16. Small amounts of androgenic steroids are secreted by the adrenal cortex.<br><br>17. Adrenal androgenic steroids play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facial hair during puberty.<br><br>18. Pancreas is a composite gland which acts as both exocrine and endocrine gland.<br><br>19. The endocrine pancreas consists of Islets of Langerhans.<br><br>20. There are about 1 to 2 million Islets of Langerhans in a normal human pancreas.<br><br>21. The Islets of Langerhans represent only 1 to 2 percent of the pancreatic tissue.<br><br>22. The two main types of cells in the Islets of Langerhans are alpha cells and beta cells.<br><br>23. The alpha cells secrete a hormone called glucagon.<br><br>24. The beta cells secrete insulin hormone.<br><br>25. Glucagon is a peptide hormone that plays an important role in maintaining normal blood glucose levels.<br><br>26. Glucagon acts mainly on liver cells or hepatocytes.<br><br>27. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in increased blood glucose called hyperglycemia.<br><br>28. Glucagon stimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to hyperglycemia.<br><br>29. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and utilisation.<br><br>30. Glucagon is a hyperglycemic hormone that increases blood glucose levels.<br><br>31. Insulin is a peptide hormone which plays a major role in regulation of glucose homeostasis.<br><br>32.

Glucose homeostasis in blood is maintained jointly by two hormones: insulin and glucagon.<br><br>5. Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called diabetes mellitus.<br><br>6. Diabetes mellitus is associated with loss of glucose through urine and formation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies.<br><br>7. Diabetic patients are successfully treated with insulin therapy.<br><br>8. A pair of testis is present in the scrotal sac outside abdomen of male individuals.<br><br>9. Testis performs dual functions as a primary sex organ as well as an endocrine gland.<br><br>10. Testis is composed of seminiferous tubules and stromal or interstitial tissue.<br><br>11. The Leydig cells or interstitial cells are present in the intertubular spaces of testis.<br><br>12. Leydig cells produce a group of hormones called androgens mainly testosterone.<br><br>13.

Erythropoietin stimulates erythropoiesis which is formation of red blood cells.<br><br>16. Endocrine cells present in different parts of gastro-intestinal tract secrete four major peptide hormones.<br><br>17. The four major GI hormones are gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin or CCK and gastric inhibitory peptide or GIP.<br><br>18. Gastrin acts on gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen.<br><br>19. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and stimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions.<br><br>20. CCK acts on both pancreas and gall bladder.<br><br>21. CCK stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile juice respectively.<br><br>22. GIP inhibits gastric secretion and motility.<br><br>23. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones called growth factors.<br><br>24. Growth factors are essential for normal growth of tissues and their repairing or regeneration.<br><br>25.

The number of ovules in an ovary may be one as in wheat, paddy, and mango, to many as in papaya, water melon, and orchids.<br><br>3. The ovule is a small structure attached to the placenta by means of a stalk called funicle.<br><br>4. The body of the ovule fuses with funicle in the region called hilum.<br><br>5. Hilum represents the junction between ovule and funicle.<br><br>6. Each ovule has one or two protective envelopes called integuments.<br><br>7. Integuments encircle the nucellus except at the tip where a small opening called the micropyle is organised.<br><br>8. Opposite the micropylar end is the chalaza, representing the basal part of the ovule.<br><br>9. Enclosed within the integuments is a mass of cells called the nucellus.<br><br>10. Cells of the nucellus have abundant reserve food materials.<br><br>11. Located in the nucellus is the embryo sac or female gametophyte.<br><br>12. An ovule generally has a single embryo sac formed from a megaspore.<br><br>13. Megasporogenesis is the process of formation of megaspores from the megaspore mother cell.<br><br>14.

Wind pollination is quite common in grasses.<br><br>8. Pollination by water is quite rare in flowering plants and is limited to about 30 genera, mostly monocotyledons.<br><br>9. Water is a regular mode of transport for the male gametes among the lower plant groups such as algae, bryophytes and pteridophytes.<br><br>10. The distribution of some bryophytes and pteridophytes is believed to be limited because of the need for water for the transport of male gametes and fertilisation.<br><br>11. Examples of water pollinated plants are Vallisneria and Hydrilla which grow in fresh water.<br><br>12. Several marine sea grasses such as Zostera are examples of water pollinated plants.<br><br>13. Not all aquatic plants use water for pollination; in a majority of aquatic plants such as water hyacinth and water lily, the flowers emerge above the level of water and are pollinated by insects or wind as in most of the land plants.<br><br>14. In Vallisneria, the female flower reaches the surface of water by the long stalk.<br><br>15. In Vallisneria, the male flowers or pollen grains are released on to the surface of water and are carried passively by water currents.<br><br>16. Some of the male flowers or pollen grains in Vallisneria eventually reach the female flowers and the stigma.<br><br>17. In seagrasses, female flowers remain submerged in water and the pollen grains are released under the water.<br><br>18. Pollen grains in many water-pollinated species such as seagrasses are long, ribbon like.<br><br>19. Pollen grains in seagrasses are carried passively inside the water and some of them reach the stigma and achieve pollination.<br><br>20. In most of the water-pollinated species, pollen grains are protected from wetting by a mucilaginous covering.<br><br>21. Both wind and water pollinated flowers are not very colourful and do not produce nectar.<br><br>22. Wind and water pollinated flowers do not produce nectar because they do not need to attract animal pollinators.<br><br>23. Figure 1.10 shows a wind-pollinated plant with compact inflorescence and exposed stamens."],

In some species, pollen release and stigma receptivity are not synchronised - either released before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive much before the release of pollen.<br><br>10. In some other species, the anther and stigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in contact with the stigma of the same flower.<br><br>11. Both these devices (dichogamy and herkogamy) prevent autogamy.<br><br>12. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility.<br><br>13. Self-incompatibility is a genetic mechanism that prevents self-pollen from the same flower or other flowers of the same plant from fertilising the ovules.<br><br>14.

In artificial hybridisation experiments, it is important to ensure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination and the stigma is protected from contamination from unwanted pollen.<br><br>15. Protection from unwanted pollen is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques.<br><br>16. If the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from the flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is necessary.<br><br>17. This step of removing anthers is referred to as emasculation.<br><br>18. Emasculated flowers have to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter paper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen.<br><br>19. This process is called bagging.<br><br>20. When the stigma of bagged flower attains receptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent are dusted on the stigma.<br><br>21. After pollination, the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits are allowed to develop.<br><br>22. If the female parent produces unisexual flowers, there is no need for emasculation.<br><br>23. The female flower buds are bagged before the flowers open.<br><br>24. When the stigma becomes receptive, pollination is carried out using the desired pollen and the flower is rebagged."],

The number of free nuclei formed before cellularisation varies greatly.<br><br>6. The coconut water from tender coconut is nothing but free-nuclear endosperm made up of thousands of nuclei.<br><br>7. The surrounding white kernel in coconut is the cellular endosperm.<br><br>8. Endosperm may either be completely consumed by the developing embryo before seed maturation as in pea, groundnut, and beans.<br><br>9. Endosperm may persist in the mature seed as in castor and coconut and be used up during seed germination.<br><br>10. Endosperm is persistent in cereals like wheat, rice and maize.<br><br>11. Embryo develops at the micropylar end of the embryo sac where the zygote is situated.<br><br>12. Most zygotes divide only after certain amount of endosperm is formed.<br><br>13. The delayed division of zygote is an adaptation to provide assured nutrition to the developing embryo.<br><br>14. Though the seeds differ greatly, the stages of embryo development (embryogeny) are similar in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons.<br><br>15.

Epicotyl has a shoot apex and a few leaf primordia enclosed in a hollow foliar structure, the coleoptile.<br><br>4. In angiosperms, the seed is the final product of sexual reproduction.<br><br>5. The seed is often described as a fertilised ovule.<br><br>6. Seeds are formed inside fruits.<br><br>7. A seed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis.<br><br>8. The cotyledons of the embryo are simple structures, generally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves as in legumes.<br><br>9. Mature seeds may be non-albuminous or ex-albuminous.<br><br>10.

In some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of nucellus are also persistent. This residual, persistent nucellus is the perisperm.<br><br>13. Integuments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats.<br><br>14.

Mammary glands contain glandular tissue and variable amount of fat.<br><br>4. The glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 15 to 20 mammary lobes.<br><br>5. Each mammary lobe contains clusters of cells called alveoli.<br><br>6. The cells of alveoli secrete milk which is stored in the cavities or lumens of alveoli.<br><br>7. The alveoli open into mammary tubules.<br><br>8. The tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct.<br><br>9. Several mammary ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla.<br><br>10. The mammary ampulla is connected to lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out.<br><br>11. Gametogenesis is the process by which gametes are produced in primary sex organs.<br><br>12. The primary sex organs are testis in males and ovaries in females.<br><br>13. Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm formation in testis that begins at puberty.<br><br>14. The immature male germ cells are called spermatogonia.<br><br>15. Spermatogonia are present on the inside wall of seminiferous tubules.<br><br>16. Spermatogonia multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers.<br><br>17. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes.<br><br>18. Some of the spermatogonia are called primary spermatocytes.<br><br>19. Primary spermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis.<br><br>20. A primary spermatocyte completes the first meiotic division called reduction division.<br><br>21. First meiotic division leads to formation of two equal haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes.<br><br>22. Secondary spermatocytes have only 23 chromosomes each.<br><br>23. Secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to produce four equal haploid spermatids.<br><br>24. Spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa or sperms by the process called spermiogenesis.<br><br>25. After spermiogenesis, sperm heads become embedded in the Sertoli cells.<br><br>26. Sperms are finally released from the seminiferous tubules by the process called spermiation.<br><br>27. Spermatogenesis starts at puberty due to significant increase in secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone or GnRH.<br><br>28. GnRH is a hypothalamic hormone.<br><br>29. Increased levels of GnRH act at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulate secretion of two gonadotropins - luteinising hormone or LH and follicle stimulating hormone or FSH.<br><br>30. LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates synthesis and secretion of androgens.<br><br>31. Androgens in turn stimulate the process of spermatogenesis.<br><br>32.

A mature sperm is a microscopic structure composed of a head, neck, middle piece and tail.<br><br>3. A plasma membrane envelops the whole body of sperm.<br><br>4. The sperm head contains an elongated haploid nucleus.<br><br>5. The anterior portion of sperm nucleus is covered by a cap-like structure called acrosome.<br><br>6. The acrosome is filled with enzymes that help fertilisation of the ovum.<br><br>7. The middle piece possesses numerous mitochondria which produce energy for movement of tail.<br><br>8.

Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and prostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms.<br><br>14. The seminal plasma along with the sperms constitute the semen.<br><br>15. The functions of male sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by testicular hormones called androgens.<br><br>16.

Oogenesis is initiated during the embryonic development stage.<br><br>19. A couple of million gamete mother cells called oogonia are formed within each fetal ovary.<br><br>20.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The secretion of gonadotropins LH and FSH increases gradually during the follicular phase.<br><br>2. LH and FSH stimulate follicular development as well as secretion of estrogens by the growing follicles.<br><br>3. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of cycle at about 14th day.<br><br>4. Rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle is called LH surge.<br><br>5. LH surge induces rupture of Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum called ovulation.<br><br>6. The ovulation or ovulatory phase is followed by the luteal phase.<br><br>7. During luteal phase, the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform into the corpus luteum.<br><br>8. The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone.<br><br>9. Progesterone is essential for maintenance of the endometrium.<br><br>10. Such an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum and other events of pregnancy.<br><br>11. During pregnancy all events of the menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation.<br><br>12. In the absence of pregnancy, the rapture of the endometrium leads to menstruation, marking a new cycle.<br><br>13. In human beings, menstrual cycles cease around 50 years of age and that is termed as menopause.<br><br>14. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal reproductive phase.<br><br>15. Cyclic menstruation extends between menarche and menopause.<br><br>16. During copulation or coitus, semen is released by the penis into the vagina called insemination.<br><br>17. The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix, enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the fallopian tube.<br><br>18. The ovum released by the ovary is also transported to the ampullary region.<br><br>19. Fertilisation takes place in the ampullary region of fallopian tube.<br><br>20. Fertilisation can only occur if the ovum and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region.<br><br>21. This is the reason why not all copulations lead to fertilisation and pregnancy.<br><br>22. The process of fusion of a sperm with an ovum is called fertilisation.<br><br>23. During fertilisation, a sperm comes in contact with the zona pellucida layer of the ovum.<br><br>24. The contact induces changes in the membrane that block the entry of additional sperms.<br><br>25.

Parturition is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism.<br><br>18. The signals for parturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta.<br><br>19. These signals induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex.<br><br>20. The foetal ejection reflex triggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary.<br><br>21. Oxytocin acts on the uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions.<br><br>22. The stronger contractions stimulate further secretion of oxytocin.<br><br>23. The stimulatory reflex between the uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in stronger and stronger contractions.<br><br>24. This leads to expulsion of the baby out of the uterus through the birth canal called parturition.<br><br>25. Soon after the infant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus.<br><br>26. The mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during pregnancy.<br><br>27. The mammary glands start producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by the process called lactation.<br><br>28. Lactation helps the mother in feeding the new-born baby.<br><br>29. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called colostrum.<br><br>30. Colostrum contains several antibodies absolutely essential to develop resistance for the new-born babies.<br><br>31. Breast-feeding during the initial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up a healthy baby."],

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Better awareness about sex related matters, increased number of medically assisted deliveries and better post-natal care have led to decreased maternal and infant mortality rates.<br><br>2. Increased number of couples with small families, better detection and cure of STDs and overall increased medical facilities for all sex-related problems have led to an improved reproductive health of the society.<br><br>3. In the last century an all-round development in various fields significantly improved the quality of life of the people.<br><br>4. Increased health facilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on the growth of population.<br><br>5. The world population which was around 2 billion or 2000 million in 1900 rocketed to about 6 billion by 2000 and 7.2 billion by 2011.<br><br>6. India's population which was approximately 350 million at the time of independence reached close to the billion mark by 2000 and crossed 1.2 billion in May 2011.<br><br>7. A rapid decline in maternal mortality rate MMR and infant mortality rate IMR as well as an increase in number of people in reproductive age are probable reasons for population increase.<br><br>8. Through Reproductive Child Health RCH programme, though we could bring down the population growth rate, it was only marginal.<br><br>9. According to the 2011 census report, the population growth rate was less than 2 per cent i.e. 20 per 1000 per year, a rate at which our population could increase rapidly.<br><br>10. An alarming growth rate could lead to an absolute scarcity of even the basic requirements i.e. food, shelter and clothing if not checked.<br><br>11. The government was forced to take up serious measures to check the population growth rate.<br><br>12. The most important step to overcome the population problem is to motivate smaller families by using various contraceptive methods.<br><br>13. Advertisements in the media as well as posters showing a happy couple with two children with a slogan Hum Do Hamare Do meaning we two, our two were used to promote small family norms.<br><br>14. Many couples mostly the young, urban, working ones have even adopted an one child norm.<br><br>15.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Natural contraceptive methods work on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum and sperms meeting.<br><br>2. Periodic abstinence is a method in which the couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual cycle when ovulation could be expected.<br><br>3. The period from day 10 to 17 of menstrual cycle is called the fertile period as chances of fertilisation are very high during this period.<br><br>4. By abstaining from coitus during the fertile period, conception could be prevented in periodic abstinence method.<br><br>5. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is a method in which the male partner withdraws his penis from the vagina just before ejaculation so as to avoid insemination.<br><br>6. Lactational amenorrhea means absence of menstruation and this method is based on the fact that ovulation and therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of intense lactation following parturition.<br><br>7. As long as the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of conception are almost nil in lactational amenorrhea method.<br><br>8. Lactational amenorrhea method has been reported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six months following parturition.<br><br>9. In natural contraceptive methods, side effects are almost nil but chances of failure are high.<br><br>10. In barrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented from physically meeting with the help of barriers.<br><br>11. Barrier contraceptive methods are available for both males and females.<br><br>12. Condoms are barriers made of thin rubber latex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or vagina and cervix in the female just before coitus so that the ejaculated semen would not enter into the female reproductive tract.<br><br>13. Nirodh is a popular brand of condom for the males.<br><br>14. Use of condoms has increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of protecting the user from contracting STIs and AIDS.<br><br>15. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are barriers made of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive tract to cover the cervix during coitus.<br><br>16. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults prevent conception by blocking the entry of sperms through the cervix.<br><br>17.

IUDs are ideal contraceptives for the females who want to delay pregnancy or space children.<br><br>3. IUD is one of most widely accepted methods of contraception in India.<br><br>4. Oral administration of small doses of either progestogens or progestogen-estrogen combinations is another contraceptive method used by the females.<br><br>5. Oral contraceptives are used in the form of tablets and hence are popularly called pills.<br><br>6. Pills have to be taken daily for a period of 21 days starting preferably within the first five days of menstrual cycle.<br><br>7. After a gap of 7 days during which menstruation occurs, pills have to be repeated in the same pattern till the female desires to prevent conception.<br><br>8. Pills inhibit ovulation and implantation as well as alter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent or retard entry of sperms.<br><br>9. Pills are very effective with lesser side-effects and are well accepted by females.<br><br>10. Saheli is the new oral contraceptive for the females that contains a non-steroidal preparation.<br><br>11. Saheli is a once a week pill with very few side-effects and high contraceptive value.<br><br>12. Saheli works by blocking estrogen receptors in the uterus preventing eggs from getting implanted.<br><br>13. Progestogens alone or in combination with estrogen can also be used by females as injections or implants under the skin.<br><br>14. The mode of action of progestogen injections or implants is similar to that of pills and their effective periods are much longer.<br><br>15. Administration of progestogens or progestogen-estrogen combinations or IUDs within 72 hours of coitus have been found to be very effective as emergency contraceptives.<br><br>16. Emergency contraceptives could be used to avoid possible pregnancy due to rapes or casual unprotected intercourse.<br><br>17. Surgical methods are also called sterilisation and are generally advised for the male or female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more pregnancies.<br><br>18. Vasectomy is the surgical sterilization method performed in males.<br><br>19. Tubectomy is the surgical sterilization method performed in females.<br><br>20. In tubectomy, a small part of the fallopian tube is removed or tied up.<br><br>21. Surgical methods like vasectomy and tubectomy block gamete transport.<br><br>22. Vasectomy does not prevent spermatogenesis but prevents sperm transport by blocking vas deferens.<br><br>23.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Infertility means couples are unable to produce children inspite of unprotected sexual co-habitation.<br><br>2. The reasons for infertility could be many including physical, congenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological factors.<br><br>3. In India, often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but more often than not, the problem lies in the male partner.<br><br>4. Specialised health care units like infertility clinics could help in diagnosis and corrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable these couples to have children.<br><br>5. Where such corrections are not possible, the couples could be assisted to have children through certain special techniques commonly known as assisted reproductive technologies ART.<br><br>6. In vitro fertilisation IVF means fertilisation outside the body in almost similar conditions as that in the body followed by embryo transfer ET.<br><br>7. IVF technique is popularly known as test tube baby programme.<br><br>8. In IVF, ova from the wife or donor female and sperms from the husband or donor male are collected and are induced to form zygote under simulated conditions in the laboratory.<br><br>9. The zygote or early embryo with upto 8 blastomeres could then be transferred into the fallopian tube which is called ZIFT meaning zygote intra fallopian transfer.<br><br>10. Embryos with more than 8 blastomeres are transferred into the uterus using IUT meaning intra uterine transfer to complete its further development.<br><br>11. Embryos formed by in-vivo fertilisation meaning fusion of gametes within the female also could be used for transfer to assist those females who cannot conceive.<br><br>12. GIFT means gamete intra fallopian transfer in which an ovum collected from a donor is transferred into the fallopian tube of another female who cannot produce one but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and further development.<br><br>13. ICSI means intra cytoplasmic sperm injection which is another specialised procedure to form an embryo in the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum.<br><br>14. ICSI is an in-vitro fertilization technique not in-vivo fertilization.<br><br>15. Infertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate the female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates could be corrected by artificial insemination AI technique.<br><br>16. In artificial insemination AI technique, the semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially introduced either into the vagina or into the uterus IUI meaning intra-uterine insemination of the female.<br><br>17. ART techniques involving in vitro fertilization include ZIFT, ICSI and IUT but not GIFT and IUI.<br><br>18. IUD is not an example of Assisted Reproductive Technology ART as it is a contraceptive device.<br><br>19. All ART techniques require extremely high precision handling by specialised professionals and expensive instrumentation.<br><br>20. ART facilities are presently available only in very few centres in the country and their benefits are affordable to only a limited number of people.<br><br>21. Emotional, religious and social factors are also obstacles in the adoption of ART methods.<br><br>22. Since the ultimate aim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have so many orphaned and destitute children who would probably not survive till maturity unless taken care of.<br><br>23. Our laws permit legal adoption and it is as yet one of the best methods for couples looking for parenthood."],

Insertion or deletion of three or multiple of three bases keeps reading frame unaltered from that point onwards.<br><br>4. Francis Crick postulated that there has to be a mechanism to read the code and link it to amino acids.<br><br>5. Amino acids have no structural specificities to read the genetic code uniquely.<br><br>6. Francis Crick postulated the presence of an adapter molecule that would read the code and bind to specific amino acids.<br><br>7. The tRNA was initially called sRNA (soluble RNA).<br><br>8. tRNA was known before the genetic code was postulated.<br><br>9. The role of tRNA as an adapter molecule was assigned much later.<br><br>10. tRNA has an anticodon loop that has bases complementary to the code.<br><br>11. tRNA has an amino acid acceptor end to which it binds to amino acids.<br><br>12. tRNAs are specific for each amino acid.<br><br>13. For initiation of translation, there is another specific tRNA referred to as initiator tRNA.<br><br>14. There are no tRNAs for stop codons.<br><br>15. The secondary structure of tRNA looks like a clover leaf.<br><br>16. In actual three-dimensional structure, tRNA is a compact molecule which looks like inverted L.<br><br>17. Translation refers to the process of polymerisation of amino acids to form a polypeptide.<br><br>18. The order and sequence of amino acids are defined by the sequence of bases in the mRNA.<br><br>19. Amino acids are joined by a bond which is known as a peptide bond.<br><br>20. Formation of peptide bond requires energy.<br><br>21. In the first phase of translation, amino acids are activated in the presence of ATP.<br><br>22. Activated amino acids are linked to their cognate tRNA.<br><br>23.

The cellular factory responsible for synthesising proteins is the ribosome.<br><br>3. The ribosome consists of structural RNAs and about 80 different proteins.<br><br>4. In its inactive state, ribosome exists as two subunits - a large subunit and a small subunit.<br><br>5. When small subunit encounters an mRNA, the process of translation of mRNA to protein begins.<br><br>6. There are two sites in the large subunit for subsequent amino acids to bind and be close enough for peptide bond formation.<br><br>7. The ribosome acts as a catalyst for the formation of peptide bond.<br><br>8. 23S rRNA in bacteria is the enzyme or ribozyme for the formation of peptide bond.<br><br>9. A translational unit in mRNA is the sequence of RNA flanked by the start codon AUG and the stop codon.<br><br>10. The translational unit has the coding sequence in between start and stop codons.<br><br>11. mRNA has some additional sequences that are not translated and are referred to as untranslated regions or UTR.<br><br>12. UTRs are present at both 5' end before start codon and at 3' end after stop codon.<br><br>13. UTRs are required for efficient translation process.<br><br>14. For initiation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon AUG.<br><br>15. The start codon AUG is recognised only by the initiator tRNA.<br><br>16. The ribosome proceeds to the elongation phase of protein synthesis after initiation.<br><br>17. During elongation, complexes composed of amino acid linked to tRNA sequentially bind to appropriate codon in mRNA.<br><br>18. Binding occurs by forming complementary base pairs with the tRNA anticodon.<br><br>19. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the mRNA during elongation.<br><br>20. Amino acids are added one by one and translated into polypeptide sequences dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA.<br><br>21. At the end of translation, a release factor binds to the stop codon.<br><br>22. Binding of release factor results in terminating translation and releasing the complete polypeptide from the ribosome.<br><br>23.

Bacteria use galactose and glucose as a source of energy.<br><br>4. If bacteria do not have lactose around them, they no longer require synthesis of beta-galactosidase enzyme.<br><br>5. Metabolic, physiological or environmental conditions regulate the expression of genes.<br><br>6. Development and differentiation of embryo into adult organisms result from coordinated regulation of expression of several sets of genes.<br><br>7. In prokaryotes, control of the rate of transcriptional initiation is the predominant site for control of gene expression.<br><br>8. In a transcription unit, the activity of RNA polymerase at a given promoter is regulated by interaction with accessory proteins.<br><br>9. Accessory proteins affect the ability of RNA polymerase to recognise start sites.<br><br>10. Regulatory proteins can act both positively as activators and negatively as repressors.<br><br>11. The accessibility of promoter regions of prokaryotic DNA is regulated by interaction of proteins with sequences termed operators.<br><br>12. The operator region is adjacent to the promoter elements in most operons.<br><br>13. The sequences of the operator bind a repressor protein.<br><br>14. Each operon has its specific operator and specific repressor.<br><br>15. lac operator is present only in the lac operon and it interacts specifically with lac repressor only.<br><br>16. The elucidation of lac operon was a result of close association between geneticist Francois Jacob and biochemist Jacque Monod.<br><br>17. They were the first to elucidate a transcriptionally regulated system.<br><br>18. In lac operon, lac refers to lactose.<br><br>19. A polycistronic structural gene is regulated by a common promoter and regulatory genes.<br><br>20. Such arrangement is very common in bacteria and is referred to as operon.<br><br>21.

Lactose is transported into cells through the action of permease enzyme.<br><br>5. A very low level of expression of lac operon has to be present in the cell all the time, otherwise lactose cannot enter the cells.<br><br>6. The lactose then induces the operon.<br><br>7. The repressor of the operon is synthesised all-the-time constitutively from the i gene.<br><br>8. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon.<br><br>9. When repressor binds to operator, it prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon.<br><br>10. In the presence of an inducer such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is inactivated by interaction with the inducer.<br><br>11. Inactivation of repressor allows RNA polymerase access to the promoter.<br><br>12. When RNA polymerase gets access to promoter, transcription proceeds.<br><br>13.

The universe expanded after Big Bang and hence the temperature came down.<br><br>5. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later after the universe expanded.<br><br>6. The gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the present day universe.<br><br>7.

There was no atmosphere on early earth and water vapour, methane, carbondioxide and ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface.<br><br>9. UV rays from the sun brokeup water into Hydrogen and Oxygen and the lighter Hydrogen escaped.<br><br>10. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water, carbon dioxide and others.<br><br>11. The ozone layer was formed as earth cooled.<br><br>12. As it cooled, the water vapor fell as rain to fill all the depressions and form oceans.<br><br>13.

Oparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that the first form of life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules like RNA and protein.<br><br>21.

Health increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal mortality.<br><br>5. Balanced diet, personal hygiene and regular exercise are very important to maintain good health.<br><br>6. Yoga has been practised since time immemorial to achieve physical and mental health.<br><br>7. Awareness about diseases and their effect on bodily functions is necessary for good health.<br><br>8. Vaccination or immunisation against infectious diseases is important for achieving good health.<br><br>9. Proper disposal of wastes, control of vectors and maintenance of hygiene in food and water resources are necessary for achieving good health.<br><br>10. When functioning of one or more organs or systems is adversely affected with signs and symptoms, we have a disease.<br><br>11. Diseases can be broadly grouped into infectious and non-infectious diseases.<br><br>12. Diseases which are easily transmitted from one person to another are called infectious diseases.<br><br>13. Infectious diseases are very common and everyone suffers from these at sometime or other.<br><br>14. Some infectious diseases like AIDS are fatal.<br><br>15. Among non-infectious diseases, cancer is the major cause of death.<br><br>16. Drug and alcohol abuse also affect our health adversely.<br><br>17. A wide range of organisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoans and helminths could cause diseases in man.<br><br>18. Disease-causing organisms are called pathogens.<br><br>19. Most parasites are pathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in or on them.<br><br>20. Pathogens enter our body by various means, multiply and interfere with normal vital activities.<br><br>21. Pathogens cause morphological and functional damage to the host.<br><br>22. Pathogens have to adapt to life within the environment of the host.<br><br>23. Pathogens that enter the gut must survive in stomach at low pH and resist various digestive enzymes.<br><br>24. Salmonella typhi is a pathogenic bacterium which causes typhoid fever in human beings.<br><br>25. Salmonella typhi generally enters the small intestine through food and water contaminated with them.<br><br>26. Salmonella typhi migrates to other organs through blood.<br><br>27. Sustained high fever ranging from 39 degree to 40 degree C is a symptom of typhoid.<br><br>28. Weakness, stomach pain, constipation, headache and loss of appetite are common symptoms of typhoid.<br><br>29. Intestinal perforation and death may occur in severe cases of typhoid fever."],

Mary Mallon nicknamed Typhoid Mary was a typhoid carrier who spread typhoid through the food she prepared.<br><br>3. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae bacteria are responsible for pneumonia in humans.<br><br>4. Pneumonia infects the alveoli or air filled sacs of the lungs.<br><br>5. In pneumonia, the alveoli get filled with fluid leading to severe problems in respiration.<br><br>6. Symptoms of pneumonia include fever, chills, cough and headache.<br><br>7. In severe cases of pneumonia, lips and finger nails may turn gray to bluish in colour.<br><br>8. A healthy person acquires pneumonia by inhaling droplets or aerosols released by infected person.<br><br>9. Pneumonia can also spread by sharing glasses and utensils with an infected person.<br><br>10. Dysentery, plague and diphtheria are some other bacterial diseases in man.<br><br>11. Rhino viruses cause one of the most infectious human ailments - the common cold.<br><br>12. Rhino viruses infect the nose and respiratory passage but not the lungs.<br><br>13. Common cold is characterised by nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache and tiredness.<br><br>14. Common cold usually lasts for 3-7 days.<br><br>15. Droplets from cough or sneezes of infected person are inhaled directly or transmitted through contaminated objects.<br><br>16. Contaminated objects like pens, books, cups, doorknobs, computer keyboard or mouse can cause infection in healthy person.<br><br>17. Some human diseases are caused by protozoans.<br><br>18. Malaria is a disease man has been fighting since many years.<br><br>19. Plasmodium, a tiny protozoan, is responsible for malaria.<br><br>20. Different species of Plasmodium like P. vivax, P. malariae and P. falciparum are responsible for different types of malaria.<br><br>21. Malignant malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is the most serious one and can even be fatal.<br><br>22. Plasmodium enters the human body as sporozoites through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito.<br><br>23. Plasmodium parasites initially multiply within the liver cells.<br><br>24. After multiplying in liver, Plasmodium attacks the red blood cells resulting in their rupture.<br><br>25. The rupture of RBCs is associated with release of a toxic substance haemozoin.<br><br>26. Haemozoin is responsible for the chill and high fever recurring every three to four days in malaria.<br><br>27. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person, parasites enter the mosquito body and undergo further development.<br><br>28. The parasites multiply within mosquito to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands.<br><br>29. When mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into human body thereby initiating infection.<br><br>30. The malarial parasite requires two hosts - human and mosquitoes - to complete its life cycle.<br><br>31. Humans are the intermediate hosts in malarial life cycle.<br><br>32.

Sewage treatment is carried out in two stages: primary and secondary treatment.<br><br>3. Primary treatment steps involve physical removal of particles from sewage.<br><br>4. Both large and small particles are removed through filtration and sedimentation.<br><br>5. In primary treatment, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration.<br><br>6. Grit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by sedimentation in primary treatment.<br><br>7. All solids that settle form the primary sludge.<br><br>8. The supernatant forms the effluent after primary treatment.<br><br>9. The effluent from primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.<br><br>10. Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment.<br><br>11. Primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>12. In aeration tanks, effluent is constantly agitated mechanically.<br><br>13. Air is pumped into aeration tanks during secondary treatment.<br><br>14. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into flocs.<br><br>15. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh-like structures.<br><br>16. Growing microbes consume the major part of organic matter in the effluent.<br><br>17. This significantly reduces the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the effluent.<br><br>18. BOD refers to the amount of oxygen consumed if all organic matter in one litre of water were oxidised by bacteria.<br><br>19. Sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced.<br><br>20. The BOD test measures the rate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a water sample.<br><br>21. Indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present in the water.<br><br>22. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting potential.<br><br>23. Once BOD is reduced significantly, effluent is passed into a settling tank.<br><br>24. In settling tank, bacterial flocs are allowed to sediment.<br><br>25. This sediment is called activated sludge.<br><br>26. A small part of activated sludge is pumped back into aeration tank as inoculum.<br><br>27. The remaining major part of sludge is pumped into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters.<br><br>28. In anaerobic sludge digesters, bacteria grow anaerobically.<br><br>29. These bacteria digest the bacteria and fungi in the sludge.<br><br>30. During digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide.<br><br>31. These gases form biogas which can be used as source of energy.<br><br>32.

Cutting by restriction enzymes leaves single stranded portions at the ends called overhanging stretches.<br><br>6. The overhanging stretches are called sticky ends on each strand.<br><br>7. Sticky ends are named so because they form hydrogen bonds with their complementary cut counterparts.<br><br>8. The stickiness of the ends facilitates the action of the enzyme DNA ligase.<br><br>9. Restriction endonucleases are used in genetic engineering to form recombinant molecules of DNA.<br><br>10. Recombinant molecules of DNA are composed of DNA from different sources or genomes.<br><br>11. When cut by the same restriction enzyme, the resultant DNA fragments have the same kind of sticky-ends.<br><br>12. DNA fragments with same kind of sticky-ends can be joined together end-to-end using DNA ligases.<br><br>13. In recombinant DNA technology, both foreign DNA and vector DNA (plasmid) are cut by the same restriction enzyme at specific point.<br><br>14.

Restriction enzyme digestions are performed by incubating purified DNA molecules with the restriction enzyme at the optimal conditions for that specific enzyme.<br><br>2. Agarose gel electrophoresis is employed to check the progression of a restriction enzyme digestion.<br><br>3. DNA is a negatively charged molecule, hence it moves towards the positive electrode or anode during electrophoresis.<br><br>4. The process of restriction enzyme digestion is repeated with the vector DNA also.<br><br>5. The joining of DNA involves mixing cut out gene of interest from source DNA and the cut vector with space, then adding ligase enzyme.<br><br>6. After cutting and joining, this results in the preparation of recombinant DNA.<br><br>7. PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction.<br><br>8. In PCR, multiple copies of the gene or DNA of interest is synthesised in vitro using two primers.<br><br>9. Each PCR cycle has three steps: denaturation, primer annealing and extension of primers.<br><br>10. The first step in PCR is denaturation where double stranded DNA separates into single strands.<br><br>11. The second step in PCR is primer annealing where primers bind to complementary sequences on single stranded DNA.<br><br>12. The third step in PCR is extension of primers using DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) and deoxynucleotides.<br><br>13. Taq polymerase is a thermostable DNA polymerase used in PCR for extension step.<br><br>14. PCR requires DNA polymerase and deoxynucleotides for the extension step.<br><br>15.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Three options for increasing food production are agro-chemical based agriculture, organic agriculture, and genetically engineered crop-based agriculture.<br><br>2. The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was still insufficient to feed the growing human population.<br><br>3. Increased yields during Green Revolution were mainly due to improved crop varieties, better management practices, and use of agrochemicals like fertilisers and pesticides.<br><br>4. Agrochemicals are often too expensive for farmers in developing countries limiting their accessibility.<br><br>5. Further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding methods alone.<br><br>6. Traditional breeding techniques failed to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement.<br><br>7. Tissue culture technology was developed during the 1950s when scientists learnt that whole plants could be regenerated from explants.<br><br>8. An explant is any part of a plant taken out and grown in a test tube under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>9. Totipotency is the capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell or explant.<br><br>10. The nutrient medium in tissue culture must provide a carbon source such as sucrose along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators.<br><br>11. Growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins are essential components of tissue culture nutrient medium.<br><br>12. Micro-propagation is the method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture in short durations.<br><br>13. Plants produced through tissue culture are genetically identical to the original plant and are called somaclones.<br><br>14. Important food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been produced on commercial scale using micro-propagation.<br><br>15. Recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants is an important application of tissue culture method.<br><br>16. Even if a plant is infected with a virus, the meristem including apical and axillary regions remains free of virus.<br><br>17. Virus-free plants can be obtained by removing the meristem and growing it in vitro conditions.<br><br>18. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato for virus-free plant production.<br><br>19. Protoplasts are naked plant cells surrounded only by plasma membranes after digestion of their cell walls.<br><br>20. Scientists have isolated single cells from plants and digested their cell walls to obtain isolated protoplasts.<br><br>21. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties with desirable characters can be fused to get hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>22. Hybrid protoplasts can be further grown to form a new plant with combined desirable traits.<br><br>23. Hybrids produced by protoplast fusion are called somatic hybrids and the process is called somatic hybridisation.<br><br>24. Tissue culture allows propagation of a large number of plants in short durations through micro-propagation technique.<br><br>25. Sterile conditions are essential for growing explants in tissue culture to prevent contamination."],

Growing bacterium in nutrient broth allows production of as much insulin as needed.<br><br>15. Insulin cannot be orally administered to diabetic patients as it is a protein that gets digested in the digestive system.<br><br>16. Insulin used for diabetes was earlier extracted from pancreas of slaughtered cattle and pigs.<br><br>17. Insulin from animal sources caused some patients to develop allergy or other types of reactions to the foreign protein.<br><br>18. Insulin consists of two short polypeptide chains named chain A and chain B.<br><br>19. The two polypeptide chains of insulin (chain A and chain B) are linked together by disulphide bridges.<br><br>20. Genetically engineered insulin is produced using Escherichia coli bacterium through recombinant DNA technology.<br><br>21. Biotechnological applications in medicine focus on production of safe and effective therapeutic drugs.<br><br>22. Recombinant DNA technology eliminates the problem of immunological responses associated with non-human derived therapeutics.<br><br>23. The use of genetically engineered insulin overcomes the allergic reactions caused by animal-derived insulin.<br><br>24.

Ecology can be studied at various levels of biological organization including organisms, populations, communities and biomes.<br><br>3. Population ecology specifically explores ecological processes at the population level.<br><br>4. A population consists of individuals of a species living in a well defined geographical area, sharing or competing for similar resources, and potentially interbreeding.<br><br>5. Although interbreeding implies sexual reproduction, groups formed through asexual reproduction can also be called populations for ecological studies.<br><br>6. Examples of populations include cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teak wood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate, and lotus plants in a pond.<br><br>7. Natural selection operates at the population level to evolve desired traits, even though individual organisms must cope with environmental changes.<br><br>8. Population ecology is important because it links ecology to population genetics and evolution.<br><br>9. A population has certain attributes that an individual organism does not possess.<br><br>10. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has birth rates and death rates.<br><br>11. Birth rates and death rates in a population refer to per capita births and deaths respectively.<br><br>12. Population rates are expressed as changes in numbers with respect to members of the population.<br><br>13. Birth rate calculation example: If 20 lotus plants produced 8 new plants, the birth rate is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>14. Death rate calculation example: If 4 out of 40 fruitflies died in one week, the death rate is 4 divided by 40 equals 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.<br><br>15. Sex ratio is a population attribute that indicates the proportion of males and females in the population.<br><br>16. An individual can be either male or female, but a population has a sex ratio such as 60 per cent females and 40 per cent males.<br><br>17. A population at any given time is composed of individuals of different ages.<br><br>18. Age distribution is plotted as per cent individuals of a given age or age group for the population.<br><br>19. The age distribution structure when plotted is called the age pyramid.<br><br>20.

Three types of age pyramids represent population status: expanding, stable, and declining populations.<br><br>3. An expanding age pyramid has a large pre-reproductive base indicating population growth.<br><br>4. A stable age pyramid shows relatively equal distribution among different age groups.<br><br>5. A declining age pyramid has a small pre-reproductive base compared to older age groups.<br><br>6. The size of a population tells us a lot about its status in the habitat.<br><br>7. All ecological processes in a population are evaluated in terms of changes in population size.<br><br>8. Population size in nature can be as low as less than 10 like Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands or go into millions like Chlamydomonas in a pond.<br><br>9. Population size is technically called population density and designated as N.<br><br>10. Population density need not necessarily be measured in numbers only.<br><br>11. Total number is generally the most appropriate measure of population density but can be meaningless or difficult to determine in some cases.<br><br>12. When comparing 200 carrot grass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants with a single huge banyan tree, stating banyan density is low underestimates the enormous role of the banyan.<br><br>13. Per cent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of population size when number-based density is inadequate.<br><br>14. Total number is not an easily adoptable measure if the population is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming.<br><br>15. For dense laboratory culture of bacteria in a petri dish, density is the best measure to report.<br><br>16.

Number of fish caught per trap is good enough measure of total population density in a lake.<br><br>18.

Connell's elegant field experiments showed that on the rocky sea coasts of Scotland, the larger and competitively superior barnacle Balanus dominates the intertidal area, and excludes the smaller barnacle Chathamalus from that zone.<br><br>11. In general, herbivores and plants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than carnivores.<br><br>12. Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated eventually.<br><br>13. Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle may be true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise.<br><br>14. More recent studies do not support such gross generalisations about competition.<br><br>15. While recent studies do not rule out the occurrence of interspecific competition in nature, they point out that species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that promote co-existence rather than exclusion.<br><br>16. One such mechanism for co-existence is resource partitioning.<br><br>17. If two species compete for the same resource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance, different times for feeding or different foraging patterns.<br><br>18. MacArthur showed that five closely related species of warblers living on the same tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to behavioural differences in their foraging activities.<br><br>19. Considering that the parasitic mode of life ensures free lodging and meals, it is not surprising that parasitism has evolved."],

Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific, meaning they can parasitise only a single species of host.<br><br>3.

Special adaptations of parasites include the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive system and high reproductive capacity.<br><br>6. The life cycles of parasites are often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host.<br><br>7.
