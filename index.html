Genetically modified microbes, fungi, plants and animals are used in biotechnology for large-scale production.<br><br>3. Applications of biotechnology include therapeutics, diagnostics, genetically modified crops, processed food, bioremediation, waste treatment, and energy production.<br><br>4. Three critical research areas of biotechnology are: providing the best catalyst, creating optimal conditions for catalyst action, and downstream processing technologies.<br><br>5. The best catalyst in biotechnology is usually an improved organism, typically a microbe, or a pure enzyme.<br><br>6. Creating optimal conditions through engineering is essential for a catalyst to act effectively in biotechnology processes.<br><br>7. Downstream processing technologies are used to purify the protein or organic compound produced through biotechnology.<br><br>8. Biotechnology has been used by humans to improve the quality of human life, especially in food production and health.<br><br>9. Biotechnological applications in agriculture focus on increasing food production through various approaches.<br><br>10. Agro-chemical based agriculture is one of the three options for increasing food production through biotechnology.<br><br>11.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Three options for increasing food production are agro-chemical based agriculture, organic agriculture, and genetically engineered crop-based agriculture.<br><br>2. The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but was still insufficient to feed the growing human population.<br><br>3. Increased yields during Green Revolution were mainly due to improved crop varieties, better management practices, and use of agrochemicals like fertilisers and pesticides.<br><br>4. Agrochemicals are often too expensive for farmers in developing countries limiting their accessibility.<br><br>5. Further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding methods alone.<br><br>6. Traditional breeding techniques failed to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement.<br><br>7. Tissue culture technology was developed during the 1950s when scientists learnt that whole plants could be regenerated from explants.<br><br>8. An explant is any part of a plant taken out and grown in a test tube under sterile conditions in special nutrient media.<br><br>9. Totipotency is the capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell or explant.<br><br>10. The nutrient medium in tissue culture must provide a carbon source such as sucrose along with inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators.<br><br>11. Growth regulators like auxins and cytokinins are essential components of tissue culture nutrient medium.<br><br>12. Micro-propagation is the method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture in short durations.<br><br>13. Plants produced through tissue culture are genetically identical to the original plant and are called somaclones.<br><br>14. Important food plants like tomato, banana, and apple have been produced on commercial scale using micro-propagation.<br><br>15. Recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants is an important application of tissue culture method.<br><br>16. Even if a plant is infected with a virus, the meristem including apical and axillary regions remains free of virus.<br><br>17. Virus-free plants can be obtained by removing the meristem and growing it in vitro conditions.<br><br>18. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane, and potato for virus-free plant production.<br><br>19. Protoplasts are naked plant cells surrounded only by plasma membranes after digestion of their cell walls.<br><br>20. Scientists have isolated single cells from plants and digested their cell walls to obtain isolated protoplasts.<br><br>21. Isolated protoplasts from two different plant varieties with desirable characters can be fused to get hybrid protoplasts.<br><br>22. Hybrid protoplasts can be further grown to form a new plant with combined desirable traits.<br><br>23. Hybrids produced by protoplast fusion are called somatic hybrids and the process is called somatic hybridisation.<br><br>24. Tissue culture allows propagation of a large number of plants in short durations through micro-propagation technique.<br><br>25. Sterile conditions are essential for growing explants in tissue culture to prevent contamination."],

Pomato is a hybrid plant produced by fusion of tomato and potato protoplasts but lacked desired commercial characteristics.<br><br>3. Use of genetically modified crops is a possible solution to minimise fertiliser and chemical usage and their harmful environmental effects.<br><br>4. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) are plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by manipulation.<br><br>5. Genetic modification has made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, salt and heat.<br><br>6. GM crops have reduced reliance on chemical pesticides through development of pest-resistant varieties.<br><br>7. Genetic modification has helped reduce post harvest losses in agricultural produce.<br><br>8. GM crops have increased efficiency of mineral usage by plants which prevents early exhaustion of soil fertility.<br><br>9. Golden rice is a genetically modified crop with enhanced nutritional value containing Vitamin A enrichment.<br><br>10. GM technology has been used to create tailor-made plants supplying alternative resources like starches, fuels and pharmaceuticals to industries.<br><br>11. Bt toxin is produced by a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis and is used in pest resistant plant production.<br><br>12. Bt toxin gene has been cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis and expressed in cotton to create insect resistance without insecticides.<br><br>13. Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and soyabean are examples of pest-resistant GM crops.<br><br>14. Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill lepidopterans like tobacco budworm and armyworm.<br><br>15. Bacillus thuringiensis also kills coleopterans like beetles and dipterans like flies and mosquitoes.<br><br>16. Bacillus thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth.<br><br>17. The protein crystals of Bacillus thuringiensis contain a toxic insecticidal protein.<br><br>18. Bt toxin protein exists as inactive protoxins in the bacterium which do not harm Bacillus thuringiensis itself.<br><br>19. When an insect ingests the inactive Bt toxin, it is converted into active form due to the alkaline pH of the gut.<br><br>20. The alkaline pH of insect gut solubilises the Bt toxin protein crystals converting them to active form.<br><br>21. The activated Bt toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells of insects.<br><br>22. Activated Bt toxin creates pores in midgut epithelial cells that increase cell swelling and lysis.<br><br>23. The pores created by Bt toxin eventually cause death of the insect through cell lysis.<br><br>24. Bt cotton is effectively a bio-pesticide as it produces toxin that kills insects without need for chemical insecticides.<br><br>25.

}], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Specific Bt toxin genes were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and incorporated into several crop plants such as cotton.<br><br>2. The choice of cry genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest as most Bt toxins are insect group specific.<br><br>3. The toxin produced by Bt genes is coded by a gene named cry which stands for crystal protein.<br><br>4. The genes cryIAc and cryIIAb encode proteins that control cotton bollworms.<br><br>5. The gene cryIAb encodes protein that controls corn borer.<br><br>6. There are multiple cry genes for example cryIAc, cryIIAb and cryIAb each targeting specific insect pests.<br><br>7. Several nematodes parasitise a wide variety of plants and animals including human beings.<br><br>8. Meloidogyne incognita is a nematode that infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction in yield.<br><br>9. A novel strategy based on RNA interference (RNAi) was adopted to prevent nematode infestation in tobacco plants.<br><br>10. RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense.<br><br>11. RNA interference involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule.<br><br>12. The complementary dsRNA molecule binds to mRNA and prevents translation of the mRNA causing silencing.<br><br>13. The source of complementary RNA in RNAi could be from infection by viruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements like transposons.<br><br>14. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that replicate via an RNA intermediate.<br><br>15. Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plant for RNAi-based resistance.<br><br>16. The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti sense RNA in the host cells.<br><br>17. The sense and antisense RNA are complementary to each other and form a double stranded RNA (dsRNA).<br><br>18. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) initiates RNAi and thus silences the specific mRNA of the nematode.<br><br>19. The consequence of RNAi was that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA.<br><br>20. The transgenic tobacco plant expressing specific interfering RNA prevents survival of Meloidogyne incognita nematode.<br><br>21. RNAi is used as a method to develop pest-resistant plants particularly against nematode infestations.<br><br>22. The mechanism of RNAi provides a targeted approach to control specific pests without affecting other organisms.<br><br>23. Complementary RNA molecules are essential for the RNAi mechanism to function effectively in silencing target genes.<br><br>24. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer is used to introduce nematode-specific genes for creating transgenic pest-resistant plants.<br><br>25.

          "190": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The living world is fascinatingly diverse and amazingly complex.<br><br>2. Biological complexity can be understood by investigating processes at various levels of biological organization.<br><br>3. The levels of biological organization include macromolecules, cells, tissues, organs, individual organisms, population, communities, ecosystems and biomes.<br><br>4. At any level of biological organization, two types of questions can be asked: how-type and why-type questions.<br><br>5. How-type questions seek the mechanism behind the biological process.<br><br>6. Why-type questions seek the significance of the biological process.<br><br>7. Example of how-type question: How does the bird sing? The answer involves the operation of the voice box and the vibrating bone in the bird.<br><br>8. Example of why-type question: Why does the bird sing? The answer may lie in the bird's need to communicate with its mate during breeding season.<br><br>9. Observing nature with a scientific frame of mind leads to formulation of many interesting questions of both types.<br><br>10. Example questions from nature observation include: Why are right-blooming flowers generally white? How does the bee know which flower has nectar? Why does cactus have so many thorns? How does the chick recognize her own mother?<br><br>11. Scientific inquiry in biology involves asking questions about mechanisms and significance at multiple organizational levels.<br><br>12. Understanding biological processes requires investigation of both operational mechanisms and evolutionary or ecological significance."],
"191": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Ecology is the subject that studies interactions among organisms and between organisms and their physical abiotic environment.<br><br>2. Ecology can be studied at various levels of biological organization including organisms, populations, communities and biomes.<br><br>3. Population ecology specifically explores ecological processes at the population level.<br><br>4. A population consists of individuals of a species living in a well defined geographical area, sharing or competing for similar resources, and potentially interbreeding.<br><br>5. Although interbreeding implies sexual reproduction, groups formed through asexual reproduction can also be called populations for ecological studies.<br><br>6. Examples of populations include cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teak wood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate, and lotus plants in a pond.<br><br>7. Natural selection operates at the population level to evolve desired traits, even though individual organisms must cope with environmental changes.<br><br>8. Population ecology is important because it links ecology to population genetics and evolution.<br><br>9. A population has certain attributes that an individual organism does not possess.<br><br>10. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has birth rates and death rates.<br><br>11. Birth rates and death rates in a population refer to per capita births and deaths respectively.<br><br>12. Population rates are expressed as changes in numbers with respect to members of the population.<br><br>13. Birth rate calculation example: If 20 lotus plants produced 8 new plants, the birth rate is 8 divided by 20 equals 0.4 offspring per lotus per year.<br><br>14. Death rate calculation example: If 4 out of 40 fruitflies died in one week, the death rate is 4 divided by 40 equals 0.1 individuals per fruitfly per week.<br><br>15. Sex ratio is a population attribute that indicates the proportion of males and females in the population.<br><br>16. An individual can be either male or female, but a population has a sex ratio such as 60 per cent females and 40 per cent males.<br><br>17. A population at any given time is composed of individuals of different ages.<br><br>18. Age distribution is plotted as per cent individuals of a given age or age group for the population.<br><br>19. The age distribution structure when plotted is called the age pyramid.<br><br>20. For human populations, age pyramids generally show age distribution of males and females in a combined diagram.<br><br>21. The size, density, births, deaths, and age distribution collectively indicate whether a population is growing, stable, or declining."],
"192": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Age pyramids for human populations show three main categories: pre-reproductive, reproductive, and post-reproductive age groups.<br><br>2. Three types of age pyramids represent population status: expanding, stable, and declining populations.<br><br>3. An expanding age pyramid has a large pre-reproductive base indicating population growth.<br><br>4. A stable age pyramid shows relatively equal distribution among different age groups.<br><br>5. A declining age pyramid has a small pre-reproductive base compared to older age groups.<br><br>6. The size of a population tells us a lot about its status in the habitat.<br><br>7. All ecological processes in a population are evaluated in terms of changes in population size.<br><br>8. Population size in nature can be as low as less than 10 like Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands or go into millions like Chlamydomonas in a pond.<br><br>9. Population size is technically called population density and designated as N.<br><br>10. Population density need not necessarily be measured in numbers only.<br><br>11. Total number is generally the most appropriate measure of population density but can be meaningless or difficult to determine in some cases.<br><br>12. When comparing 200 carrot grass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants with a single huge banyan tree, stating banyan density is low underestimates the enormous role of the banyan.<br><br>13. Per cent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of population size when number-based density is inadequate.<br><br>14. Total number is not an easily adoptable measure if the population is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming.<br><br>15. For dense laboratory culture of bacteria in a petri dish, density is the best measure to report.<br><br>16. For certain ecological investigations, there is no need to know absolute population densities; relative densities serve the purpose equally well.<br><br>17. Number of fish caught per trap is good enough measure of total population density in a lake.<br><br>18. Population sizes are mostly estimated indirectly without actually counting or seeing them.<br><br>19. Tiger census in national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and fecal pellets.<br><br>20. The size of a population for any species is not a static parameter and keeps changing with time.<br><br>21. Population size changes depend on various factors including food availability, predation pressure and adverse weather.<br><br>22. Changes in population density give us some idea of what is happening in the population - whether it is flourishing or declining.<br><br>23. The density of a population in a given habitat during a given period fluctuates due to changes in four basic processes."],
"193": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Population density fluctuates due to changes in four basic processes: natality, mortality, immigration, and emigration.<br><br>2. Two processes contribute to an increase in population density: natality and immigration.<br><br>3. Two processes contribute to a decrease in population density: mortality and emigration.<br><br>4. Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the population that are added to the initial density.<br><br>5. Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given period.<br><br>6. Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period under consideration.<br><br>7. Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under consideration.<br><br>8. If N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t+1 is: Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) - (D + E)].<br><br>9. In the population density equation, B represents natality or births.<br><br>10. In the population density equation, I represents immigration.<br><br>11. In the population density equation, D represents mortality or deaths.<br><br>12. In the population density equation, E represents emigration.<br><br>13. Population density will increase if the number of births plus the number of immigrants (B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus the number of emigrants (D + E).<br><br>14. Under normal conditions, births and deaths are the most important factors influencing population density.<br><br>15. Immigration and emigration assume importance only under special conditions.<br><br>16. If a new habitat is just being colonized, immigration may contribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates.<br><br>17. In Figure 11.2, natality and immigration are shown with positive signs indicating increase in population density.<br><br>18. In Figure 11.2, mortality and emigration are shown with negative signs indicating decrease in population density.<br><br>19. The population density equation shows that population change is determined by the balance between factors that increase density and factors that decrease density."],
         "194": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Growth models describe whether the growth of a population with time shows any specific and predictable pattern.<br><br>2. Exponential growth occurs when resource (food and space) availability is unlimited allowing unimpeded growth of a population.<br><br>3. When resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number.<br><br>4. Darwin observed that populations grow in an exponential or geometric fashion while developing his theory of natural selection.<br><br>5. In exponential growth, if population size is N, per capita birth rate is b, and per capita death rate is d, then dN/dt = (b - d) Ã— N.<br><br>6. When (b - d) is replaced by r, the equation becomes dN/dt = rN.<br><br>7. The parameter r is called the intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>8. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is a very important parameter chosen for assessing impacts of any biotic or abiotic factor on population growth.<br><br>9. The r value for the Norway rat is 0.015.<br><br>10. The r value for the flour beetle is 0.12.<br><br>11. In 1981, the r value for human population in India was 0.0205.<br><br>12. To calculate the current r value, you need to know the birth rates and death rates.<br><br>13. The exponential or geometric growth pattern of a population results in a J-shaped curve when N is plotted in relation to time.<br><br>14. If you are familiar with basic calculus, you can derive the integral form of the exponential growth equation as Nt = N0 ert.<br><br>15. In the equation Nt = N0 ert, Nt represents population density after time t.<br><br>16. In the equation Nt = N0 ert, N0 represents population density at time zero.<br><br>17. In the equation Nt = N0 ert, r represents intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>18. In the equation Nt = N0 ert, e represents the base of natural logarithms which equals 2.71828.<br><br>19. Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous population densities in a short time.<br><br>20. Figure 11.3 shows the population growth curve where the plot is exponential with K representing carrying capacity.<br><br>21. In exponential growth, both per capita birth rates and per capita death rates are used, not total numbers.<br><br>22. The exponential growth model helps understand how different animal populations behave and shows restraints on growth that can teach lessons on controlling population growth."], 
          "195": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Darwin showed that even a slow growing animal like elephant could reach enormous numbers in the absence of checks.<br><br>2. The chess-wheat anecdote demonstrates how fast a huge population could build up when growing exponentially.<br><br>3. In the chess story, the minister wanted wheat grains calculated by placing one grain in Square 1, then two in Square 2, then four in Square 3, and eight in Square 4, doubling each time the previous quantity at the next square.<br><br>4. A chess board has 64 squares in total.<br><br>5. The king realized that all the wheat produced in his entire kingdom pooled together could still be inadequate to cover all the 64 squares.<br><br>6. A tiny organism reproducing by binary fission, doubling in numbers every day, would reach a mind-boggling population size in 64 days, provided food and space remain unlimited.<br><br>7. No population of any species in nature has at its disposal unlimited resources to permit exponential growth.<br><br>8. Limited resources lead to competition between individuals for limited resources.<br><br>9. Eventually, the fittest individual will survive and reproduce in populations with limited resources.<br><br>10. Governments of many countries have realized the fact of limited resources and introduced various restraints to limit human population growth.<br><br>11. In nature, a given habitat has enough resources to support a maximum possible number, beyond which no further growth is possible.<br><br>12. The limit of maximum possible number is called nature's carrying capacity, represented by K for that species in that habitat.<br><br>13. A population growing in a habitat with limited resources shows initially a lag phase.<br><br>14. The lag phase is followed by phases of acceleration and deceleration.<br><br>15. Finally, the population reaches an asymptote when the population density reaches the carrying capacity.<br><br>16. A plot of N (population density) in relation to time (t) results in a sigmoid curve for logistic growth.<br><br>17. This type of population growth is called Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth as shown in Figure 11.3.<br><br>18. Logistic growth is described by the equation: dN/dt = rN[(K - N)/K].<br><br>19. In the logistic growth equation, K represents the carrying capacity.<br><br>20. In the logistic growth equation, N represents the population density.<br><br>21. In the logistic growth equation, r represents the intrinsic rate of natural increase.<br><br>22. The term [(K - N)/K] in the logistic equation represents the effect of resource limitation on growth.<br><br>23. When N approaches K in logistic growth, the population growth rate approaches zero at the asymptote phase.<br><br>24. Logistic growth differs from exponential growth because it considers limited resources and carrying capacity."],
       "196": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. In the logistic growth model, N represents population density at time t, r represents intrinsic rate of natural increase, and K represents carrying capacity.<br><br>2. Since resources for growth for most animal populations are finite and become limiting sooner or later, the logistic growth model is considered a more realistic one.<br><br>3. Government Census data for India for the last 100 years can be plotted to check which growth pattern is evident.<br><br>4. Populations evolve to maximise their reproductive fitness, also called Darwinian fitness, in the habitat in which they live.<br><br>5. Under a particular set of selection pressures, organisms evolve towards the most efficient reproductive strategy.<br><br>6. Some organisms breed only once in their lifetime, such as Pacific salmon fish and bamboo.<br><br>7. Others breed many times during their lifetime, such as most birds and mammals.<br><br>8. Some organisms produce a large number of small-sized offspring, such as oysters and pelagic fishes.<br><br>9. Others produce a small number of large-sized offspring, such as birds and mammals.<br><br>10. Ecologists suggest that life history traits of organisms have evolved in relation to the constraints imposed by the abiotic and biotic components of the habitat in which they live.<br><br>11. Evolution of life history traits in different species is currently an important area of research being conducted by ecologists.<br><br>12. There is no natural habitat on earth that is inhabited by just a single species, and such a situation is even inconceivable.<br><br>13. For any species, the minimal requirement is one more species on which it can feed.<br><br>14. Even a plant species which makes its own food cannot survive alone.<br><br>15. Plant species need soil microbes to break down the organic matter in soil and return the inorganic nutrients for absorption.<br><br>16. Plants need to manage pollination with the help of animal agents.<br><br>17. In nature, animals, plants and microbes do not and cannot live in isolation but interact in various ways to form a biological community.<br><br>18. Even in minimal communities, many interactive linkages exist, although all may not be readily apparent.<br><br>19. Interspecific interactions arise from the interaction of populations of two different species.<br><br>20. Interspecific interactions could be beneficial, detrimental or neutral to one of the species or both.<br><br>21. Plus sign is assigned for beneficial interaction in interspecific interactions.<br><br>22. Minus sign is assigned for detrimental interaction in interspecific interactions.<br><br>23. Zero is assigned for neutral interaction (neither harm nor benefit) in interspecific interactions.<br><br>24. All the possible outcomes of interspecific interactions are listed in Table 11.1."],
          "197": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Table 11.1 shows six types of population interactions based on the effects on Species A and Species B.<br><br>2. When both Species A and B show plus sign, the interaction is mutualism where both species benefit.<br><br>3. When both Species A and B show minus sign, the interaction is competition where both species lose.<br><br>4. When Species A shows plus and Species B shows minus, the interaction is either predation or parasitism.<br><br>5. In predation, the predator benefits and the prey is harmed.<br><br>6. In parasitism, the parasite benefits and the host is harmed.<br><br>7. When Species A shows plus and Species B shows zero, the interaction is commensalism.<br><br>8. In commensalism, one species is benefitted and the other is neither benefitted nor harmed.<br><br>9. When Species A shows minus and Species B shows zero, the interaction is amensalism.<br><br>10. In amensalism, one species is harmed whereas the other is unaffected.<br><br>11. Both species benefit in mutualism and both lose in competition in their interactions with each other.<br><br>12. In both parasitism and predation, only one species benefits (parasite and predator respectively) and the interaction is detrimental to the other species (host and prey respectively).<br><br>13. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common characteristic: the interacting species live closely together.<br><br>14. Predation can be thought of as nature's way of transferring to higher trophic levels the energy fixed by plants.<br><br>15. When we think of predator and prey, probably it is the tiger and the deer that readily come to our mind.<br><br>16. A sparrow eating any seed is no less a predator than a tiger eating deer.<br><br>17. Although animals eating plants are categorised separately as herbivores, they are in a broad ecological context not very different from predators.<br><br>18. Besides acting as conduits for energy transfer across trophic levels, predators play other important roles.<br><br>19. Predators keep prey populations under control.<br><br>20. Without predators, prey species could achieve very high population densities and cause ecosystem instability.<br><br>21. When certain exotic species are introduced into a geographical area, they become invasive and start spreading fast because the invaded land does not have its natural predators.<br><br>22. The prickly pear cactus introduced into Australia in the early 1920's caused havoc by spreading rapidly into millions of hectares of rangeland.<br><br>23. The invasive prickly pear cactus was brought under control only after a cactus-feeding predator (a moth) from its natural habitat was introduced into the country.<br><br>24. Biological control methods adopted in agricultural pest control are based on the ability of the predator to control pest populations."], 
          "198": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Predators help in maintaining species diversity in a community by reducing the intensity of competition among competing prey species.<br><br>2. In the rocky intertidal communities of the American Pacific Coast, the starfish Pisaster is an important predator.<br><br>3. In a field experiment, when all the starfish were removed from an enclosed intertidal area, more than 10 species of invertebrates became extinct within a year because of inter-specific competition.<br><br>4. If a predator is too efficient and overexploits its prey, then the prey might become extinct and following it, the predator will also become extinct for lack of food.<br><br>5. This is the reason why predators in nature are prudent.<br><br>6. Prey species have evolved various defenses to lessen the impact of predation.<br><br>7. Some species of insects and frogs are cryptically-coloured or camouflaged to avoid being detected easily by the predator.<br><br>8. Some prey species are poisonous and therefore avoided by the predators.<br><br>9. The Monarch butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator (bird) because of a special chemical present in its body.<br><br>10. Interestingly, the Monarch butterfly acquires this chemical during its caterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed.<br><br>11. For plants, herbivores are the predators.<br><br>12. Nearly 25 per cent of all insects are known to be phytophagous, feeding on plant sap and other parts of plants.<br><br>13. The problem of herbivory is particularly severe for plants because, unlike animals, they cannot run away from their predators.<br><br>14. Plants therefore have evolved an astonishing variety of morphological and chemical defences against herbivores.<br><br>15. Thorns in Acacia and Cactus are the most common morphological means of defence against herbivores.<br><br>16. Many plants produce and store chemicals that make the herbivore sick when they are eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion, disrupt its reproduction or even kill it.<br><br>17. The weed Calotropis growing in abandoned fields produces highly poisonous cardiac glycosides.<br><br>18. That is why you never see any cattle or goats browsing on Calotropis plant.<br><br>19. A wide variety of chemical substances that we extract from plants on a commercial scale such as nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium, etc., are produced by them actually as defences against grazers and browsers.<br><br>20. When Darwin spoke of the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest in nature, he was convinced that interspecific competition is a potent force in organic evolution.<br><br>21. It is generally believed that competition occurs when closely related species compete for the same resources that are limiting, but this is not entirely true.<br><br>22. Firstly, totally unrelated species could also compete for the same resource.<br><br>23. For instance, in some shallow South American lakes, visiting flamingoes and resident fishes compete for their common food, the zooplankton in the lake."],
          "199": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Resources need not be limiting for competition to occur.<br><br>2. In interference competition, the feeding efficiency of one species might be reduced due to the interfering and inhibitory presence of the other species, even if resources (food and space) are abundant.<br><br>3. Competition is best defined as a process in which the fitness of one species (measured in terms of its r: the intrinsic rate of increase) is significantly lower in the presence of another species.<br><br>4. It is relatively easy to demonstrate competition in laboratory experiments, as Gause and other experimental ecologists did.<br><br>5. When resources are limited, the competitively superior species will eventually eliminate the other species.<br><br>6. Evidence for competitive exclusion occurring in nature is not always conclusive, but strong and persuasive circumstantial evidence does exist in some cases.<br><br>7. The Abingdon tortoise in Galapagos Islands became extinct within a decade after goats were introduced on the island, apparently due to the greater browsing efficiency of the goats.<br><br>8. Another evidence for the occurrence of competition in nature comes from what is called competitive release.<br><br>9. A species whose distribution is restricted to a small geographical area because of the presence of a competitively superior species, is found to expand its distributional range dramatically when the competing species is experimentally removed.<br><br>10. Connell's elegant field experiments showed that on the rocky sea coasts of Scotland, the larger and competitively superior barnacle Balanus dominates the intertidal area, and excludes the smaller barnacle Chathamalus from that zone.<br><br>11. In general, herbivores and plants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than carnivores.<br><br>12. Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated eventually.<br><br>13. Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle may be true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise.<br><br>14. More recent studies do not support such gross generalisations about competition.<br><br>15. While recent studies do not rule out the occurrence of interspecific competition in nature, they point out that species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that promote co-existence rather than exclusion.<br><br>16. One such mechanism for co-existence is resource partitioning.<br><br>17. If two species compete for the same resource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance, different times for feeding or different foraging patterns.<br><br>18. MacArthur showed that five closely related species of warblers living on the same tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to behavioural differences in their foraging activities.<br><br>19. Considering that the parasitic mode of life ensures free lodging and meals, it is not surprising that parasitism has evolved."], 
          "200": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Parasitism has evolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher vertebrates.<br><br>2. Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific, meaning they can parasitise only a single species of host.<br><br>3. Both host and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host evolves special mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite, the parasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise them.<br><br>4. In order to be successful with the same host species, parasites evolved special adaptations.<br><br>5. Special adaptations of parasites include the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive system and high reproductive capacity.<br><br>6. The life cycles of parasites are often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host.<br><br>7. The human liver fluke (a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail and a fish) to complete its life cycle.<br><br>8. The malarial parasite needs a vector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts.<br><br>9. Majority of the parasites harm the host; they may reduce the survival, growth and reproduction of the host and reduce its population density.<br><br>10. Parasites might render the host more vulnerable to predation by making it physically weak.<br><br>11. An ideal parasite should be able to thrive within the host without harming it, but natural selection did not lead to the evolution of such totally harmless parasites.<br><br>12. Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites.<br><br>13. The most familiar examples of ectoparasites are the lice on humans and ticks on dogs.<br><br>14. Many marine fish are infested with ectoparasitic copepods.<br><br>15. Cuscuta is a parasitic plant that is commonly found growing on hedge plants.<br><br>16. Cuscuta has lost its chlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution.<br><br>17. Cuscuta derives its nutrition from the host plant which it parasitises.<br><br>18. The female mosquito is not considered a parasite, although it needs our blood for reproduction (not for nutrition).<br><br>19. Endoparasites are those that live inside the host body at different sites (liver, kidney, lungs, red blood cells, etc.).<br><br>20. The life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their extreme specialisation.<br><br>21. The morphological and anatomical features of endoparasites are greatly simplified while emphasising their reproductive potential.<br><br>22. Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism in which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and lets the host incubate them.<br><br>23. During the course of evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the host's egg in size and colour to reduce the chances of the host detecting them."],
          "201": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. Brood parasitism can be observed by following the movements of the cuckoo or koel and the crow in your neighborhood park during the breeding season (spring to summer).<br><br>2. Commensalism is the interaction in which one species benefits and the other is neither harmed nor benefited.<br><br>3. An orchid growing as an epiphyte on a mango branch is an example of commensalism where the orchid benefits but the mango tree derives no apparent benefit.<br><br>4. Barnacles growing on the back of a whale benefit while the whale derives no apparent benefit, which is commensalism.<br><br>5. The cattle egret and grazing cattle in close association is a classic example of commensalism.<br><br>6. The egrets always forage close to where the cattle are grazing because the cattle, as they move, stir up and flush out insects from the vegetation that otherwise might be difficult for the egrets to find and catch.<br><br>7. Another example of commensalism is the interaction between sea anemone that has stinging tentacles and the clown fish that lives among them.<br><br>8. The clown fish gets protection from predators which stay away from the stinging tentacles of the anemone.<br><br>9. The anemone does not appear to derive any benefit by hosting the clown fish.<br><br>10. Mutualism is an interaction that confers benefits on both the interacting species.<br><br>11. Lichens represent an intimate mutualistic relationship between a fungus and photosynthesising algae or cyanobacteria.<br><br>12. Mycorrhizae are associations between fungi and the roots of higher plants.<br><br>13. In mycorrhizae, the fungi help the plant in the absorption of essential nutrients from the soil.<br><br>14. In mycorrhizae, the plant in turn provides the fungi with energy-yielding carbohydrates.<br><br>15. Figure 11.4 shows the mutual relationship between fig tree and wasp where the fig flower is pollinated by wasp and the wasp lays eggs in a fig fruit."],
          "202": [[], "NEET POINTERS:<br><br>1. The most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples of mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships.<br><br>2. Plants need the help of animals for pollinating their flowers and dispersing their seeds.<br><br>3. Animals obviously have to be paid fees for the services that plants expect from them.<br><br>4. Plants offer rewards or fees in the form of pollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for seed dispersers.<br><br>5. The mutually beneficial system should also be safeguarded against cheaters, for example, animals that try to steal nectar without aiding in pollination.<br><br>6. Plant-animal interactions often involve co-evolution of the mutualists, that is, the evolutions of the flower and its pollinator species are tightly linked with one another.<br><br>7. In many species of fig trees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp as shown in Figure 11.4.<br><br>8. A given fig species can be pollinated only by its partner wasp species and no other species.<br><br>9. The female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying) site but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing its larvae.<br><br>10. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescences while searching for suitable egg-laying sites.<br><br>11. In return for the favour of pollination the fig offers the wasp some of its developing seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae.<br><br>12. Orchids show a bewildering diversity of floral patterns many of which have evolved to attract the right pollinator insect (bees and bumblebees) and ensure guaranteed pollination by it as shown in Figure 11.5.<br><br>13. Not all orchids offer rewards to their pollinators.<br><br>14. The Mediterranean orchid Ophrys employs sexual deceit to get pollination done by a species of bee.<br><br>15. One petal of the Ophrys flower bears an uncanny resemblance to the female of the bee in size, colour and markings.<br><br>16. The male bee is attracted to what it perceives as a female, pseudocopulates with the flower, and during that process is dusted with pollen from the flower.<br><br>17. When this same bee pseudocopulates with another flower, it transfers pollen to it and thus, pollinates the flower.<br><br>18. Co-evolution operates such that if the bee's colour patterns change even slightly (for any reason) during evolution, pollination success will be reduced unless the flower co-evolves to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the female bee.<br><br>19. Figure 11.5 shows bee as a pollinator to orchid flower."],
